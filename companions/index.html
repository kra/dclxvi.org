<h1 align=center>The Wheeled Companions.</h1>

<p>
I have had the privelege of knowing several fascinating wheelmen and
wheelwomen in my travels around the block.  Most of them aren't the
types which are easy
to write about, and some would rather I didn't even try.  I silently
appreciate those, and I pay homage to the others here.  Learn about
<a href="homage/lewis/index.html">Lewis</a>,
<a href="homage/nemo/index.html">Fred Nemo</a>, and the fabulous
<a href="homage/babydee/index.html">Baby Dee</a>.

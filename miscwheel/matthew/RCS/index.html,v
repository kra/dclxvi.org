<h1 align=center>Matthew Schekel.</h1>

<p>
I never met Matthew Schekel, but I rode on the Critical Mass that
served as his memorial ride, and I pass the spot where he was killed
whenever I'm nearby - SE 37th and Taylor in Portland.  The bike
and helmet that he was using when
he died are there as part of a memorial.

<p>
I don't think that it's my place to use Matthew as a figurehead for
my personal cycling program, since I don't know what he'd think about
it.  On the other hand, this happened to him in my neighborhood, while
he was doing something that I do there every day.  Surely everyone who
is trying to make the world a little less fucked-up has a right to
point out how fucked-up things really are.
</p>

<p>
Matthew was killed for the stupidest reason in the world.  He was
riding through an intersection where the cross-traffic had a stop
sign, and he didn't.  A
<a href="http://www.sheridanfruit.com">Sheridan Fruit</a>
truck was going the other way.
The driver didn't stop, claims that he didn't see him, and that was
looking for cars, not cyclists.  Matthew was killed on the spot.
</p>

<p>
He died because it was business as usual for that truck driver.
You've seen it everywhere - many drivers prefer to save a few seconds
of travel time, even if it means some unlucky person might get
killed.  This driver was charged with reckless driving, with a maximum
fine of 300 dollars.
</p>

<p>
I remember that whenever I'm riding down Hawthorne, a four
lane street two blocks from Taylor.  I take a lane, because it isn't
safe to ride right next to the parked cars.  Motorists are often
annoyed by this, and every once in a while, I get yelled at to &quot;stop
blocking traffic&quot;.  I am traffic!  One guy told me that there
were quieter streets a block over - like Taylor - where I should be
riding.  Why wasn't he on that street?  Why should I have to stop at
ten stop signs, and stop again at ten more intersections where cross
traffic should stop but won't?  To save time for some stupid drivers,
alone in their
cars?  Is their time more important than mine?  Is their time more
important than everyone
who gets killed by a careless driver?

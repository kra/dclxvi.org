<h1 align=center>The 2003 Brooklyn workshop.</h1>

<p>
During our visit to Brooklyn, we and the local Chunk chapter held a
mutant bike construction workshop for anyone who was interested.
</p>

<p>
Since we needed to get a pile together in a hurry, we rented a van to
do errands. One was to buy some bike frames and parts
from Mike, a homeless guy who's pile we had noticed. The
people at the park weren't put at ease
when an unmarked white van with no windows pulled up and five white
people jumped out, but we were there to do business so Mike's wife was
happy to see us. She said she'd call him. &quot;Hey, Mike!&quot; Mike was a
sweetie and loved his job, and I'm sure that his pile was about as
ethical as ours is, and ours is as ethical as it can be. &quot;Take
whatever you want except for this one, this is my special project.&quot;
I wanted to take pictures, but there were lots of drug
transactions going on around us.

<p>
The workshop was fun, but there is something kind of stupid about
hosting one for a large group of mostly unskilled strangers.
People who don't know what they are doing are our people - the
mutant bike community is made up of people like ourselves who do things
first and figure out how to do them afterwards.  Being in the middle
of 20 unknowns in an alley with power tools and welding torches
can make one jumpy,
however.  I wore my goggles the whole day because of the golden
showers of hot metal flying around.

<p>
The most memorable image was one guy cutting through a quarter-inch
pipe with a hand grinder.  The sparks were bouncing directly into his
friend's scrunched-up face, who was patiently holding the pipe down
for him.  I tried to get him to use a hacksaw, but he wanted to do it
that way.

</p>

<p>
When it got dark, we realized that we didn't have any lights, so Vog
just left the torch going.  It was like being in the kobold mines.  I
started shuffling instead of walking, because I knew that those damn
kobolds love to put a pair of handlebars in front of your feet so they
can laugh when you fall into the saw blade.  Things got kind of unreal.
When
Vog started smoking the fumes coming out of the seat tube of the bike
he was welding, it was time to call it a night.

<h1>St. Ratrick's Day.</h1>

<span class="twotext">
We visited the Chicago Rat Patrol in 2005 for St. Ratrick's Day, which
is their holiday.  They get together, crash parades, ride in
alleys as usual, and undergo "Rattification", which may involve
settling grudges, recognizing distinguished conduct, and boasting.
</span>

<span class="twotext">
I made this portable comfort chopper to send to Chicago.  Can be disassembled to fit in a normal bike box.

Silken and I arrived in town from different directions,
      and our bikes were still on a siding somewhere in the
    plains.  Johnny Payphone and Sauce met us with bikes, and we were
    able to start riding around immediately.

<span class="twotext">
Johnny was riding Pick-Up-Sticks, the Pennyfakething, um the, Rattyfarthing, ah,
  whatever, it's fucked up.  I was able to get it down the alley after
  a little practice, but then took a header trying to descend a two
  percent grade.

      When he first wheeled it out, I just pointed at those sawed off
  tubes and looked at him.  He replied, "sack the ripper."

</span>

<span class="twotext">
Anyway, our bikes still hadn't arrived, so we went for a ride which
  took us down Lower Wacker - exciting road to ride on a tallbike - and
  ended up at a great hidden spot on the concrete banks of the
  downtown Chicago river. 
</span>

<span class="twotext">
Had to try out all the bikes, of course.

<span class="twotext">
I've climbed up a few bikes, but it was not obvious where to put
  my feet on the triple-tall.  So many places.  It got kind of confusing.

<span class="twotext">
The next day we were able to pick up our bikes at Union Station.  I
used to go here during my high school lunch period and read Asimov's.

</span>

<span class="twotext">
And my friends and I used to hang out here after school, which must be why they
  locked it up.  Had I known, I would have brought a commemorative plaque to put
  on the gate.

<span class="twotext">
When we were loading the bikes on the trailer, an innertube tie
broke and smacked Johnny in the nuts.  Haw haw haw!

</span>

<span class="twotext">
      I love putting my bike back together in another city.  I look
      down while I'm riding and see my old bike, then look up and see
  a whole different city moving around me.

We went on a Rat ride.
They like to ride in alleys, root through dumpsters, and get into
      trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
      Some citizen opened his back door and almost stepped right
      in front of me as I rode by.  He did a double take and said,
      "How'ya dooin."

When we found two bottles of corn syrup, they
  showed off by passing one around and drinking the entire thing.  But
  did they try to quimby the frozen chickens?  No they did not!

Working Bikes.  They take in bikes, fix them, sell them, part them
  out, and send containers of them to Africa.

<span class="twotext">
We also drank on the bridges, of course.  This was just a rail bridge
  that I saw one day.  Chicago has lots of beautiful little steel bridges
  over the canals.

The Death Derby was held at, and in, the Wicker Park fountain.

</span>

<span class="twotext">
It started with boasts, taunts, and descriptions of acts of violence
  and the reasons why they were deserved.  The three challengers were
  Captain Stay-In-School, Dragono, and Sauce (I forget what Sauce's
  <i>nom de guerre</i> was).
</span>

</span>

<span class="twotext">
The rules were simple.  Stay on your bike and fuck up your opponents'
  bikes.  Last one rolling is the winner.  Only hurt the bikes, not
  the people.  Of course, this rule was immediately broken, it
  always is, and Sauce had blood running down his face from a cut
  below his eye at the very start.

<span class="twotext">
After the derby, we rode around and smashed T.V.s with the T.V. smasher.
Some of the T.V.s were broken stock from the Human Television
  Network, a group who mounts them on trikes to bring
  television to the streets and the people.  Other  T.V.s were
  collected in the alleys.  When 
  we had a few, we stopped and smashed them, then rode and found more.
</span>

</span>

<span class="twotext">
We rode by the fire chief, standing in the driveway of his
  fire station.  He said, "Hey, you.  I like what you're doing.  Ride
  those bikes back here", so we smashed some T.V.s behind the
  station for the firemen.  We tried to get them to pull the rope
  that fired the smasher.
</span>
<span class="twoimage">

</span>

<span class="twotext">
Before a T.V. was smashed, a list of grievances against it would be
  read.  "This television showed a football game when we wanted to
  watch <i>The Simpsons</i>!  Does anyone have anything to say in its
  defense?"
</span>

Of course nobody did.  We wanted to hear that noise.

<span class="twotext">
After the smashing, the sweeping up of the glass and toxic dust and
  stuff.  That guy in the the pink rollerblades just happened to run
  into us, I've seen him on the street in other towns also.

And then, finally, the warm bar, the showing off of Death Derby
wounds, the talking into the night.

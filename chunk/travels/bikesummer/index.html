<h1 align=center>The 1999 Bikesummer Chopper Construction Conference
in San Francisco.</h1>

<p>
In 1999, the
<a href="http://www.bikesummer.org">Bikesummer</a> organizers invited us to
teach a class on idiotic bicycle construction techniques.  We were
only too pleased to have an excuse to visit San Francisco.
</p>

<p align=center>

</p>


<p>
We arrived in two stages.  Megulon-5 took the bus down at the
beginning of Bikesummer, to soften up the couches we'd all be sleeping
on and to enjoy that SF cyclist lifestyle that is apparently found
nowhere else in the country.  He was appalled to find that the city
was already in the clutches of the <em>Black Heart Chopper Club</em>,
a group of messenger cowpoke circus freaks.
</p>

<p align=center>

</p>

<p>
They already had some bikes, but after a pile of frames destined for
the bikesummer class was deposited on their step, we all couldn't help
but make several more.  Princess's chopped scooter was used
to haul parts to King Courier, where a confederate joined them
together.  Lance E. Pants took the occasion to actually weld his
chopper, Ground Beef, which was previously held together with leather
straps.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Then Lance got so excited about his new tallbike that he lit the
mid-drive wheel on fire and rode it until the flames licking his hind
end through those thick leather pants became unbearable.
It took us a long time to put out that burning
tire.

<p>
Meanwhile, everyone else
borrowed a truck and drove down from Portland.
Most of us have spent a quiet evening passed out on a pile
of bikes, but we didn't realize how much more difficult it is in a
moving truck.  Nobody was injured and the tanks weren't breached, so
it turned out okay.

The chopper building 
    workshop was a new experience for the visiting C.H.U.N.K. 666 dignitaries 
    as well as the local participants, since we were not used to having such a 
    spacious, well-equipped shop. Having a few unfortunate people staffing the 
    welding equipment and slapping together bikes that were already cut and assembled 
    made for fast construction as well. And a spread-out selection of raw material! 
    What a luxury! Usually we have to delve into the bottom of an interlocking 
    pile of bikes to wrest what we need from the murk.
</p>

</p>

<p>
As a result, some fifteen bikes were made and ridden that day. Another
surprise is that we weren't
kicked out by the friendly staff of
<a href="http://www.thecrucible.org">The Crucible</a>,
(who let us use their space for donations, thanks!), because 
we're not exactly the most organized and safe people in the lab.
Kansas caught his arm on fire, and the welders got lots of fumes from
the chrome that the assemblers didn't file off, but there were no
major injuries.
</p>

<p>
Jay showed up on the Choppacabra, or the Chupacopper, or whatever, a
chopper with grabbing arms hooked
to the pedals and a propane flamethrower.
Let it also be known that his flexi-chopper was
the only survivor of the 
flaming ramp at the bike rodeo about a year earlier.

		Many bikes were donated 
		by the Hunter's Point bicycle program, Pedal Revolution, and a few
		other forgotten 
		origins (sorry, thanks). Sheff from Pedal Rev brought his busted old
		long chopper and turned it
		into a working new tall chopper, and used 
		it to fetch beer from the local store at least three times.
		The tall chopper, as opposed
		to the tallbike, was at the time the
		latest stage in chopper design, which Sheff apparently
        discovered at the same time that we did.

The session was followed 
by a ride through annoying Berkeley.  We stopped at the college campus
and let some kids ride for a while, only to be mobbed by packs of
suburchins who wanted to try too.  We got tired of keeping track
of all
of the leather jackets and chains that we were holding as collateral,
so we taped flares to our bikes, 
lit off a few roman candles, and rode on, only to be immediately
pulled over by the police.
Hm, I'm in a strange city on a slow bike with a flare stuck to it, should 
I stop? After calling in and finding that nobody had complained, and we hadn't 
actually hurt anybody, the disappointed officer released us. We went on to 
drink more beer and race on the university track.
</p>

<hr noshade>

<p>
Bolstered by our successful conquest of Berkeley, we returned to the
city and fully ruled it the next day, whether the locals noticed
it or not.  An idyllic ride took us all over the city and into the night.
</p>

</p>


<p>
Idyllic?  Yes, too idyllic.  Something was wrong.  The city was just too easy on us.  What
of the dreaded chopper-eating hills?  Why had nobody fallen prey to
the accursed micro-climates of the region?
Perhaps we had been lucky.  To avoid becoming soft and complacent, we
tested our mettle 
by purchasing lots of whiskey and drinking it quickly before
sailing down Lombard Street, the second most twisty road in the city.
Our losses were consistent with what we tend to suffer on the streets
of Portland, so we considered the test to be passed.

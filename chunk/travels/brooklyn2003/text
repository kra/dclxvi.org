crazy

no laws for bikes

Pedestrians and people hanging out on their porches had a lot to say
to us.  It was sometimes difficult, in this foreign East Coast
culture, to tell if people were yelling things that
were positive or negative.  Lots of bottles were raised in our honor,
and one guy jumped on his BMX bike to ride up to each of us and tell
us personally that we were all right.  My favorite responses were a
kind of respectful taunt, a message that "you guys are stupid fucked
up white kids, but that's cool, we all have our shit to do and you do
it well."

There was only one hairy situation.  I was near the back of the pack
and heard someone on the sidewalk yell "let's get 'em!"  Three guys
broke from the crowd and started running at a rider in the front of
our group.  When I saw that, I sped up and prepared to ram the runner
in front, but luckily I saw that he was slowing down before reaching
his target - it was a joke.  If I had hit him, some real shit might
have started.

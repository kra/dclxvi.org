We arrived in Seattle on Sunday night, rendezvoused at Rainier Beer,
and headed north to where we
were staying.  There we unloaded bikes, made introductions, and set out
nineteen strong for a Chunk tour of the area, and rode the waterfront
down to Gasworks Park.
On our way we picked up boxes and boxes of beer and had a brilliant
riding party with full view of downtown on the Gasworks pier.
We returned to our host's quiet neighborhood by three AM.

Monday morning, we fixed the previous night's damage to the bikes, ate a
sidewalk breakfast, and headed
back to the 
south of town, where we unloaded bikes, beds, couches, and a barbecue
in Chinatown.
We had little rides,
did more repairs, were interviewed by a Japanese-American paper, and
had
extensive
conversations with complimentary motorcycle policemen.
Then we set off for downtown.
We had an extensive tour of a very uncongested downtown, the police
gave
us a complete motorcade!   It was raining
heavily when we
finally entered the direct action network headquarters at five
o'clock.  This was a warehouse space teaming with radicals of
diverse variety, all extremely active, coming and going through tiny
hallways.  It was a major production in action, the closest I've felt to
entering a beehive.  Pretty impressive!  We left and joined a
squatters
movement down the street: a bunch of homeless folks and their
sympathizers took over some abandoned Seattle buildings to the
consternation of the police.  By six o'clock we met up with
our sister bike club in Seattle, the Dead Baby Bike Club.  We piled into
their garage and proceeded
to drink and talk bikes and compare our creations.  Somehow when we
arrived, we had lost my housemate Stephen, who had no way of
locating us.

<p>
At seven we chunked
with elation through town, and close to our destination we ran into the
steelworkers' march.  We caught the tail end and there found
Stephen.  We rode in support of the march, and were given great
acclaim.
We rode to honor them, hooting and hollering, and spoke with John
Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, while walking
our bikes with
the crowd through a small corridor.  Afterwards we returned to
our sister bike club 
headquarters near the Seattle Center.
</p>

<p>
This is where the intensity begins that doesn't let up until we lose
the Seattle radio stations on our drive home.  In the Dead Baby Bike
Club garage, I talk with their founding members with passion,
enthusiasm and genuine love.  I befriend three of them and we
all throw around sincere compliments, all sorts of wide-eyed responses in
the smallest of workshops.  We exchange histories, philosophies,
and strategies, talking in elaborate systems of thought; Dakota tells me
about the Bicycle Messiah and the religious aspects of their club.   I
am out of my mind.  I try to fill them in on how we actually
live up to everything they have read about us in our zine.  They didn't
think we still existed, that we were all a figment of
Karl's imagination.  Lovely time.

    <h2>Social Organization of the Chopper Bike Clubs of the World.</h2>
<p>
The chopper bicycle clubs of the world have differing social
organizations.
</p>

<p>
C.H.U.N.K. is mostly a meritocracy.  Those who make
the bikes get to ride the bikes, and newcomers who don't put something
together themselves usually end up with the crappier bikes until they
show that they can ride well and won't abandon them in frustration across
town.  Bikes are sometimes considered the
property of their constructors, but more often, enough hands have
destroyed and repaired a bike (in some cases, a bike has broken into
parts which have been incorporated into several new rides) that there is
an unspecified circle
of people who can ride it.
</p>

<p>
New members of S.C.A.B., it is said, are required to make and bring
their own bikes.
</p>

<p>
The D.B.B.C. is an theocracy, ruled by their queen.  Perhaps she
doesn't command them at all times, but she is their spiritual
interpreter and inspiration.

One hour later the clubs join for a tour
of the Seattle Center and surrounding area.  We are about thirty strong
and some of us are high out of our minds.  I can no longer converse
with the Dead Baby Bike Club, nor with my friends.  The rest of
the night is all about getting lost, highly complex circumnavigation
patterns about Seattle Center's enormous and deep fountains, strange
interactions with downtown's street folk, broken bikes, scary
encounters with cars, difficulty following
traffic rules, and brilliant smooth invigorating pedaling.  Moods
range from complete elation to the disturbed.  We ride until morning.
</p>

<p>
By morning, only a few of us were left.  There was no more room inside
the Dead Baby
garage, so four of us slept in the U-Haul.  Two hours later, at six AM,
we were woken by six policemen who were rude, poor with their words,
and out of their element.  They threatened to arrest me but couldn't find a
charge that wasn't pure bullshit, hokey.  Obstructing justice for
sleeping in a Uhaul in a paid parking spot?  We provoked them.  They
got real ugly,  and then when they tried to make small talk about our
bikes, Stephen told them he didn't wanna talk to them, that they should
leave us alone.  And then they left angry, we think somewhat ashamed.

Six was our wake up time anyways, so we got up and proceeded to the
middle of town.  We went for a morning ride around the many hotels
that the
dignitaries stayed in, a tour of the big scene: all the cops, the
sections of town blocked off by city bus barricades, the early morning
activities.
Plenty was going on but not near the amount of people we were hoping for,
because the twelve different marches from the periphery into town had
yet to converge upon the convention center and surrounding
intersections.  We rode around, got on the morning news with a
short interview, and tried to locate our organizing friends to no
avail.  Denk and I returned to the Dead Baby shack for an early morning nap.  I
slept next to the puking minor who had latched onto our group back in
Portland, but I didn't sleep too well cause I was still tripping.
</p>

<p>
By eleven in the morning things had reached a fierce intensity.
Police and protesting groups fought over control of the street.
Masses of people could take over the police.  Masses of police with
their armor, gas masks, tear gas, pepper spray rubber bullets, and flash
grenades... could move the people.  Intersections would switch back
and forth throughout the day.  For the most part on the
protester's side it was non-violent.  We rode around the periphery, and
were distractions and diversions for the police.  We occasionally
got center stage in the middle of intersections claimed by lines of
people chained together,
where we performed mini Chunkathlons.  All day we rode through streets
closed off by the police and along with the rest of the crowd
disobeyed the order they tried to establish.  The police had no
control over most of the city throughout the day and when they did
acquire territory it was only with full armor and crowd control
devices, which met fierce condemnation from the slow moving crowd.
</p>

<p>
At one point Stephen got his hair pulled, was pepper sprayed, and
had his bike kicked out from under him.  An arrest was threatened and
the police still
have his bike.  Most people say how brave Stephen was and how dumb the
cops
were, but my new friend Thad told me Stephen pretty much provoked the
whole thing.

<p>
The moment by moment reciprocating acquisition of territory occurred on
intersections throughout Seattle all day.  In the meantime, union
marches charged through downtown fairly independently from the fringe
group activity, as they were protected by the police and
allowed passage in police territory, and in the protester's territory
were given firm support.  One portion of a union parade was diverted
into a police/protester intersection competition.  The steelworkers
and longshoremen came to support the protesters.  This got
particularly bloody, or at least gassy and explosive, with fires,
projectiles, and all sorts of commotion.  We heard this event by radio
from our homebound car at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
So we took over intersections, shut down the WTO conference, and caused
general mayhem all throughout downtown Seattle.  You may ask what our
reason was for doing this.  There
is an enormous variety of reasons.  I guess that over fifty fringe
groups participated, all of whom have differing but these days unified
interests.  At the twelve intersections surrounding the convention
center were groups like Greenpeace, Earth First, Free Tibet, Taiwanese
independence, Copwatch, and seven others (I can't remember).  Outside
of this there were normal everyday Seattle citizens, anarchist groups
(who did the majority of the vandalism, dressed incognito in black
with black bandanas bandito-style), Christian Scientists, Methodists,
a plethora of women's groups, Jewish groups, etc. etc.  And then there
were the super-fringe groups like Chunk and the Dead Baby Bike Club,
Free Bikes of Montana, and probably tons of others.  Many were there
as much for finding a good audience as for protesting -- the nature of
fringe group gatherings.
</p>

<p>
For the most part the weekend was fun-filled, intense, highly
charged, marathonic, and eye-opening.  It was with a lot of regret
that we left Seattle when it was still at such intensity.
Chunk had its biggest ride in history outside of Portland and maybe
the longest in duration.  The next big event is the
<a href="../../operations/y2k/index.html">
millennium ride.
</a>
It is safe to say that Seattle is already
having theirs.  I wanna forget everything but the moment when were
entrenched in something magical and spectacular.

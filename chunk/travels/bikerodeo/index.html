<h1 align=center>The Bike Rodeo.</h1>

<p>
Our envoy visited San Francisco's
<a href="http://www.cyclecide.com/">Bike Rodeo</a>
in the summer of 2001 when they took
part in the &quot;How
Berkeley Can You Be&quot; parade.
The Rodeo is, as usual, a loosely organized chopper
constructing, riding, and destructing cadre.  Unlike us, however,
some of them have actual metalworking skills.
Our representative didn't introduce
himself or anything, so he didn't ask many questions.  Why
not?  Most of the Rodeoans weren't less friendly than the usual SF
crowd, or anything.  Perhaps he was afraid of having to defend our
honor
in the jousting ring.
</p>

The parade itself was somewhat annoying.  Actually, parades are always
fun, it was Berkeley that was annoying.  There were the usual
breakdowns during the ride, but luckily these people were prepared.
The Cyclopath had his fully armageddon-ready mobile-home-tallbike with
a tallbasket that had several tools clipped onto it.  When someone had
a flat, they just pulled out a tank of compressed air and filled it up
until it got low again!  Plush!
</p>

<p>
After the parade, carnival rides were set up for the kids to play on.
There was an impressive collection of stationary cycling
amusements.  Most of them were extremely dangerous to ride on
without parental supervision, which made them all the more fun for the
kids.
</p>

</p>

<p>
There were two bicycle carousels, one for big kids, and one for small
kids.  The big kid ride ended up with two blowouts by the end of the
day, which made it a little more challenging to ride, but all of the
bikes kept their alignment.
</p>

</p>

<p>
There was also a scary bike-a-totter, which hoisted its riders seven feet in
the air.  Huge springs bounced them up again when they hit the
bottom.
The Twirl-n-hurl was mounted on a gimbal, so that turning
the pedals caused the bike to rotate around a post.  It drew disgusted
stares from observers, since only a sick individual would elect to
subject themselves to such a ride.
</p>

<p>
The most horrifying ride, however, was the human powered
centrifuge.  Pictures cannot do it justice.  Two riders
sat on the ends of a 15 foot beam, which spun around when they pushed
on their pedals.  This device was well
constructed, thankfully, although it fell over if one
rider got off before the other one did.  The center post was a
tractor axle
with freewheels welded to it.  Its top speed was limited
only by
the foolishness of the riders.

<p>
And then, of course, came the jousting, the usual two falls out of
three.  The winner was clear, a sullen and cadaverous gladiator on
loan from the Hard Times Bike Club, a man who clearly had forgotten
how to feel pain or joy or anything much other than the desire to keep
the bloody side up.  He first dispatched Jay, shown on the left
receiving a glancing blow that succeeded in knocking him off balance.
Notice that his front wheel has just left the ground and his
handlebars are wrenched to the side, spelling a fall when his wheel
touches down again.  With that victory the zombie from Minneapolis won
the right to ride the tallbike that Jay had made, crafted from twin
Schwinn Varsities, the mightiest rides in the universe, and bearing
the power of seven headbadges.  From that point on he was unbeatable.
Unbeatable?  Actually, he tired out near the end, and the Cyclopath
won the last round, perhaps proving the one's best ally in the
joust is a few motorcycle batteries low on your bike to provide ballast.

<p>
Our trip to Vancouver.  How can I describe it?  It was possibly the
most
amazing and enjoyable time that I have ever experienced.
I don't have the words to explain it.  I can only show some
pictures, outline the events of those five days, and mention some of
the things that I felt at the time.  There is no way for me to convey
the dreamy mood that I experienced during the entire Vancouver
campaign.  Even the sucky parts were only
temporary setbacks in an amazing adventure.  So I won't even try.
I will only attempt to amuse the reader and provide something
that we can use to remind ourselves of our carefree youth as we grow
old and forgetful.

<h3>The Practice Sortie.  We Learn Something About Logistics.
</h3>

<p>
<img WIDTH=312 HEIGHT=206 align=right src="image/bcmolson75.jpg">
We had arrived in Vancouver the night before.  Today,
in what would become our usual morning routine, we woke up, ate a
large breakfast together, cracked some Canadian beers, and slowly
assembled and repaired bikes in the rain.
<br>
<br>
Let this story begin by praising the potency, drinkability, and
economy of the beers of Canada.  We were happy to help their economy by
buying large quantities of it.
<br>
<br>
The previous day in Portland, we had disassembled the 22 bikes with
which we planned to destroy Canada and crammed them into a
trailer and some cars.  We had just spent
a difficult week building, repairing, and assembling those bikes, also
in the rain.  As would have been expected had we thought about it,
some of those bikes would never be assembled in Canada, and would
<a href="image/hires/bcswampthing150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=179 HEIGHT=266 align=left src="image/bcswampthing75.jpg"></a>
instead provide crucial parts for more important rides.
<br>
<br>
This was the day of our warm-up ride, which served as a mutual
introduction between ourselves and Canadian society.
A nice meandering tour through the drizzle brought us to the Molson
brewery.  We tried to talk our way in over the intercom, demanding
that they give us a tour, but they wouldn't open the door.
We crossed a bridge, rode around downtown, and ran into Thud, who
had arrived that day and was randomly exploring Vancouver, looking for
us.
<br>
<br>
One of the Contessa von Denk's fork dropouts broke off.  Damn factory
welds!  Always
letting us down!
<a href="image/hires/bckaraokebridge150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=359 HEIGHT=242 align=right src="image/bckaraokebridge75.jpg"></a>
The part of the dropouts that remained had holes in
them for that drilled-out look, and we were able to bolt her wheel
into those.  It wasn't snug, but it has kept her bike rolling to this
day.  We rode to the sketchy rundown commercial area, and met a
cyclist, Neil, who said he was wondering when we would be showing up.
He could do a no-hands track stand on a derailleur bike.
</p>

<p>
When we stopped for dinner, Denk had an excellent idea and wrote a number on
each person's hand. From that point on, if we weren't sure that
everybody was there, we called out our numbers in sequence.  This was
a much needed organizational aid.  We often ride in loose groups, and it
takes a while to
find and round people up when we get separated.
Some of us had to roll
their eyes about this excess of planning - if there is anything that we are
not, it is a uniform series of components - but the new system let us
get moving much faster, and soon it became a fun
game.   Vik Gerbik got to be One, and started off the count a few times
just because he thought it would be an amusing or annoying place to do
it, like when we were
riding down a busy street in close formation.
This at least provided an educational experience for the Canadians.
There were always at least 13 of us, sometimes as many
as 16, and we had to keep
track of what the last number was as people joined or left.  There
was usually an honorary number on the hand of whatever Canadian
was riding with us at the time.
</p>

<p>
<a href="image/hires/bcforkfix150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=239 HEIGHT=356 align=right src="image/bcforkfix75.jpg"></a>
Enough of the eating and resting, it was time to find an abandoned
warehouse that we had
been told about.  Why?  I do not know.  
Some kids
on BMX bikes told us how to get around an ugly stretch of terrain, but
first, we had to refresh ourselves with more delicious Canadian
beers while repairing our second major breakdown.
Silken Thomas's fork had broken at the bottom, where the lower steer
tube was welded to a pipe.
Luckily, this is a great place for a weld to
break, because all of the parts tend to stay loosely assembled, rather
than spewing themselves and their rider down the street.
We reattached the
fork and pipe with an adequate length of duct-tape, which has kept
that bike rolling to this day as well.
</p>

<p>
<a href="image/hires/bcramp150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=352 HEIGHT=234 align=left src="image/bcramp75.jpg"></a>
On the way to the warehouse we encountered a fun ramp thingy.  If it
was crossed slowly - a challenge for most choppers - it
tilted and gently let the bike down on the other side.  While we were
milling around
and riding it for kicks, a guy named Fix rode by, and we demanded that
he ride it before he could
pass.  &quot;It's easy, just take it slow.&quot;  He coasted up and
immediately got his front wheel caught
in a groove in the middle, with his face on the cheesegrater
surface, his feet stuck in his
pedals, and his body twisted painfully.  Amazingly neither he nor his
bike was hurt, and he salvaged
his pride by getting back on and doing it properly a moment later.
</p>

<p>
Eventually we found the warehouse.  Yay, abandoned warehouse.
Luckily, it was not inhabited by chud.

<p>
While riding home we passed a murky pond by the side of the road.  For
some reason, we convinced Spidey to ride into it for two dollars
Canadian.

<h3>Canada is Dominated For Reals This Time.</h3>

<p>
<a href="image/hires/bckaraoke150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=423 HEIGHT=271 align=right src="image/bckaraoke75.jpg"></a>
After the usual, we eventually got our stuff together and
rode about two miles before Dirty performed an unsuccessful
docking with the Keg Trike, ripping out three spokes from one of its
rear wheels.  This was quite a downer, because the Keg Trike is our
supply wagon, and was carrying the tools, most of the beer, and the
karaoke machine.  It was
still rolling, just a little wobbly, so we shifted loads to other
bikes and hoped for the best.
<br>
<br>
The day really began when we stopped at a gas station for some
reason or another and ended up warming up with the first little karaoke
party of the trip.  AJ, the Canadian CHVNK, was in excellent form,
apparently drawing strength from riding on his home soil, perhaps also
because he was nominally in command of this expedition by virtue of
being our host and guide.
He showed off his amazing kung fu bike yoga moves - once he curled
his leg back around so that his foot was behind his neck, riding like
that for a block with Vik holding on to it.  He also rode
<a href="image/hires/bcride150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=235 align=left src="image/bcride75.jpg"></a>
with no hands or feet, and once crashed into Spidey, knocked him off,
and rode away with 
his bike without spilling it.
<br>
<br>
We cruised downhill and introduced ourselves again to the Canadians,
who were happy to hear us yell both &quot;Hello Canada, we love you!&quot; and
&quot;Hello Canada, we own you!&quot;, while showing no reaction to &quot;Take off,
you hosers!&quot;
</p>


<p>
There was some more singing when we found ourselves at the beach.  In
fact, there
was a little singing or dancing whenever we stopped for more than a
few minutes, part of the celebratory background that, as mentioned
earlier, just cannot be described.  Stephen took a swim while we
enjoyed the beautiful
scenery, the huge ships in the bay, the mountains, the bridge, and the
fit Canadian strollers.
</p>

<p align=center>

<a href="image/hires/bclifeguard150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=338 HEIGHT=227 src="image/bclifeguard75.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>
Spidey fulfilled his fantasy of being
a lifeguard with his beer and various lifesaving transportation
devices around him.  Soon afterwords, the real
lifeguard walked up to us and said that
since we weren't supposed to be drinking at the beach, could we please
keep our beer where he couldn't see it?  In general we had
the same minimal interactions with the authorities all week.  Yay
Canada!
Fewer roadragers, too, in general.  Because Canada usually
let us have our fun we didn't mess up Canada very much.  This was a
pleasant surprise.  We thought
that it would be like Seattle, with busybody police everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Once we reached the park on the bay the living was easy.  It was as if
Canada had made a chopper riding course for our amusement.
We cruised another mile and I got a flat from plowing up a curb,
so we stopped along the path at
a little Canadian Stonehenge, had another dance party, and watched the
boats and the Canadians while performing repairs.
At this point I noticed
that there was a scary crack in the fork of Plopulator.  In the
factory weld, of course.  This was a bit worrisome, because when the
rest of that metal gave, the bike would be toast.  Luckily, it was in a
redundant area - the other side of the fork would just sag and let me
down, and the whole bike would act as a landing skid.
If that happened, the ride might end up being over for me, seeing as the Keg
Trike probably couldn't carry me with that busted wheel.
But hey, who cares, I was in Canada, eh? And in fact the fork
lasted all day.

<p>
Silken was riding a 3-speed that day because his chopper-related knee
injury from a few years back was acting up, and he was in general
taking on the role
of keeping us all rolling - gathering the rear together, swapping parts
around, and calling out for a beer when he needed one.
Part of that job was herding Dirty around, and at this time his task
was to peel him away from the nice elderly Chinese man who probably
just wanted a
little peace.  Dirty says that he unsuccessfully tried
to get the guy to ride his bike.  Most of us encourage people to try
and ride
our bikes,
but with Dirty it seems to be some sort of universal love
communication issue.

<p>
The path led to a playground.  Spidey, who indulged in more
recreational crashes than any of us during this trip, slammed into a
swingset that a little boy was playing on with his father.  He moaned
in the sand for a little while, then introduced himself.  The father
wasn't mad and the kid didn't start crying, so he must not have gotten
too close, and they ended up hanging around with us while we got water
from the fountain.  The child liked our bikes and had fun sitting on
one, but would only get near if we stepped back a few paces.

<h3>The Most Dangerous Game.</h3>

<p>
After navigating some more streets, we rode through an amazing
park full of twisty little passages, all alike, and
got a little spread out.  Big B.
and AJ were talking to three kids at a stream.  Spidey zoomed up
out of nowhere, embedded himself in the bush next to them, said hi,
extricated his bike,
and rode off to join yet another dance party that the rest of us were
conducting a few hundred feet further.
</p>

<p align=center>
<a href="image/hires/bcparkstunts150.jpg"><img WIDTH=446 HEIGHT=296 src="image/bcparkstunts75.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>
The kids wanted to
impress Big B. and AJ, so they pulled out their BB gun and shot at
some ducks.
Nobody enjoyed seeing this, of course, and the kids were told off
thoroughly.  The incident caused something to snap in Big B., and
he gave those stupid kids the what for.
&quot;Tough kids, shoot those scary ducks!&quot;  He started dancing on the rail
of the bridge like a chicken.  &quot;Look at me, I'm a duck!  Why don't you
fucking shoot me?&quot;
</p>


<p>
Enough, the kids were embarrassed.  B. and
AJ rejoined us and we amused ourselves with stunts in the grass before
moving on.
As we were starting off, Denk, who was point, rode
towards us and told us that someone had shot her in the head with a BB!
Those punks had snuck through the bushes during our dance party and
had ambushed us!
We were enraged, of
course, and spread out to find the little jerks.  Some ran through the
bushes and trees on foot to flush them out, while others rode around the
paths to encircle them.  It was chaotic, and the sun had
set about twenty minutes ago, so it was not a sure thing by any means,
even with our numbers.  The natives were small and wily, and knew the
territory.  We were loud, disorganized, mostly drunk, and lost, and
the terrain was not hospitable to bicycles.  Also, most of us hadn't
seen the kids and probably thought that we were after a band of
chud or Canadian Nazis or something.
People were crashing through the woods, usually chasing each other.
Thud
lobbed his bike over a fence to explore one area - not an easy thing
to do in a hurry, but there was lots of adrenaline going around.
I wondered whether it would be more fun if the kids were caught or if
they got away.
</p>


<p>
Eventually Spidey and Denk spotted the tykes and gave chase.  They saw them
run into a building and pursued them into a basement corridor.  The
kids were always just out of sight, but they followed the sound of a
slamming
door and reached a bathroom, where they found two of the boys trying
to hide in a toilet stall.
As they cowered in front of him, Spidey was almost at
a loss for words, which is understandable.  It's
hard to imagine why these morons thought it would be fun to
mess with a close-knit group of
13 chopper riding ugly Americans.  &quot;What the FUCK were you thinking?  Do
you have any idea who we are?&quot;
He patted them down, but they didn't have the gun - that boy had split
off and gotten away.  The kids said that they hadn't done any
shooting, their crazy friend had done it. &quot;He has ADD!&quot;  Stupid
Canadian kids.
Spidey gave them a stern talking to and told them to get the heck
out of there, and he and Denk rejoined the group and told the rest of
us what had happened.
</p>

<p>
We didn't like getting angry at Canadians, even
stupid punk kid Canadians, and we would have liked to have been
able to break their BB gun, but it was a fun adventure and nobody
got hurt, and nobody even threatened the kids.
</p>


<h3>Pigeon Park and Gassy Jack.</h3>

<p align=center>
<a href="image/hires/bcstemfix150.jpg"><img WIDTH=451 HEIGHT=303 src="image/bcstemfix75.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>
We rode on, ran into some more arrivals from Portland, and had
some more breakdowns.  Thud's front axle
snapped, but we
moved some locknuts around from other bikes and it was more or less
rideable.  Granddaddy's stem broke!  Not too surprising that something
would happen to that bike, since Spidey was riding it and he breaks
everything, but still, a stem!  Major!  We gave him the helmet and
duct-taped the pump to the
fork and
handlebars, and that worked for a while.
</p>

<p align=center>
<a href="image/hires/bcstemfix4150.jpg"><img WIDTH=447 HEIGHT=297 src="image/bcstemfix475.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>
A mile or so down the road we saw an abandoned bike and stopped
to harvest some needed parts.  We cruised up onto
the sidewalk next to the shopping cart fort of a pair of
homeless
people, just as one of them was
screaming, &quot;Come back here, you asshole!  Help me break this up!&quot;  It
was obvious that she was an addict of some kind, not only from what she
said, but from the way that she said it - she sounded like she was
would be unable to feel any way other than utterly shitty until she
got her fix on.  So as not to disturb this depressing scene, we
shuffled over
to the square on the corner, which I think was called Pigeon
<a href="image/hires/bcpigpark150.jpg">
<img WIDTH=448 HEIGHT=303 align=right src="image/bcpigpark75.jpg"></a>
Park.
</p>

<p>
Silken started
looking over the bike
while we tended to our needs and lounged around.
Within minutes the space cushion caused by our arriving and crashing
into each
other by way of stopping began to dissolve as the more curious and
alert of the locals inched towards us.
Some of them were looking for something that we clearly didn't have
and were shooed away, but others were just interested.  We heard
the usual stories about childhoods on chopper bikes.  Dirty
made quick friends with someone and put him on Humpty.  After a few
false starts, the guy sped off around the corner and disappeared.  I
was thinking, oh well, guess Dirty's walking the rest of the way, and
took a final picture.  Libby sped
off a few seconds behind Humpty and trailed him, so things were in
control.  The guy didn't have any bad intentions, anyway, he just went
around the block and showed up a minute later.
He must have been overcome by the sudden chunk feelings that the bike
gave him and thought nothing of immediately zooming out of sight as
soon as he could.
</p>

<p>
After this incident we thought we should go somewhere calmer and moved
along a few blocks to pile the bikes around a statue (&quot;Gassy Jack&quot;).
The character of the neighborhood changed drastically - there were
stylish young people, ravers, clubbers, jocks, tourists, etc.  Weird.
</p>

<p>
Silken walked back to the abandoned bike and dragged it to where we
were.  He said that the scene back at Pigeon Park was all different
people, same action.  Someone was passed out in the gutter, and a cop
was in his car, hoping that he wouldn't have to get out and
fill out paperwork if the guy was dead.
While Silken was picking up the bike, a man
was standing in the street with his shoe in his hand, yelling, &quot;I found
my needle!  Bend over!&quot;  Silken took this as his cue to hurry up and leave.
</p>

<p>
We got some important parts from the bike, including a wheel for
Thud, and we were proud to be plundering Canada's precious resources.
Unfortunately, the stem didn't fit Granddaddy, and it was only after we
had taken off our jerryrigged splint that we
realized that we had lost
the roll of duct tape.  I walked back to Pigeon Park to look
for it.  It was quite
interesting to be walking in that area alone and visibly looking for
something - it changed the way that people interacted with me.  I got
some people offering to sell me drugs, and lots of people just looking
back at me querulously, apparently hoping that they could
perform some kind of transaction with me.  No duct tape, anyway, so
Spidey rode without handlebars for a long time, just holding onto
<a href="image/hires/bcstemfix6150.jpg">
<img align=left WIDTH=334 HEIGHT=208 src="image/bcstemfix675.jpg"></a>
the pipe of Granddaddy's fork.  This is pretty damn amazing -
that's a heavy steel tube with nothing to get a purchase on.  Uphill,
downhill, it didn't cramp his style much.  I still
barely believe it.  Try it someday, you'll see how hard it is.
</p>

<p>
We wanted to see an opera that some cyclists in dinosaur costumes
were performing under an evil sphere that symbolized Canada's lust
for technology, so we counted off and rode.  We missed the opera, but
we hung around afterwords and let people ride
our bikes.  Lucy wasn't feeling well, so I didn't talk much with
the locals, but we had some nice quiet time with others of our group,
remembering the evening, spitting in the bay.  Lucy and I ended up
locking our bikes (after cannibalizing out some important parts -
Granddaddy finally got a stem) and taking a cab home.  Ah,
the privileges of being urban and being able to afford a ride when we
need it.  We counted off one final time, and then watched the rest of
our group ride off into the night.  It was a beautiful sight, seeing a
shadowy group of riders, all different sizes and shapes, riding away
from us towards home.
</p>


<h2>Sat Aug. 25.</h2>

<h3>The Slow, Painful Day Of Socialization.</h3>

<p align=center>

<a href="image/hires/bcclass150.jpg"><img WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=298 src="image/bcclass75.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>
Today was the day of the bikesummer chopper construction class thing.
Unfortunately, most of us were very hungover, tired, and not at all
outgoing, especially at first.  We showed up, unpacked some bikes and
tools and beer and crap, said hello, and then kind of sat around
and fell asleep or talked amongst ourselves.  Hopefully we weren't
completely rude, especially
seeing as most of the Canadians that we had met were pretty friendly
and happy all of the time.
Anyway, soon enough we started fixing our
own bikes and sharing our tools and beer and mingling a little.  The
people with initiative jumped into it, we helped them out, and
eventually people got more or less greased.
</p>

<p>
Canadian Paul fixed the crack in Plopulator's fork.  We knew that it
would break again, and sure enough, within 24 hours there was another
crack right next to the old one, but it lasted the trip.
</p>


<p>
Some of the Canadians got close to finishing their bikes, and Big
B. and H&auml;ng got excited about getting them done, which was really
nice.  The organizers gave them T-shirts the next day for being so
helpful, which was also really nice.
</p>

<p>
Eventually we gathered up our crap, thanked the Canadians for their
hospitality, and left.
</p>

<h3>Further adventures of the evening as narrated by Silken.</h3>

<p>
Later that night, Thud wanted to go back 
to a messenger party on the other side of town that he had visited while 
the workshop was going down.  Big B. and Silken (who &quot;had not gotten
properly shit-piled&quot; the whole trip) joined him.
Eventually they found themselves on some sort of main drag and stopped
for a drink at a random bar.  Canadians sell pizza 
by the slice at 88 cents <em>Canadian</em>!  That’s like fifty cents
U.S.!  The
trio was forced to move on at 11, when Canadian bars 
close (!). After a long ride 
they realized they were within a 
block of the empty warehouse they had visited two nights before.
Strangely, the giant
loading dock doors were closed. Thud and Big B. opened one up and the three 
boys peered inside and saw movement.
&quot;Hello!?&quot; cried Big B. A voice boomed from within, and 
the three were greeted by this guy who’s name cannot be recalled,
Kit or Kip or something like that. His name wasn’t 
important because he carried a quarterstaff.
</p>

<p>
He said that the warehouse was his home, which he 
shared with one other transient.  He lived up in a little loft at the far 
end. From there he and his friend kept the junkies and 
prostitutes out of the place, for which the railroad 
cops apparently left them alone. He told us we were free to sleep on a 
nasty mattress. He also said 
that he had a little BB gun with which he once shot some dude in the ass 
while the dude was screwing some whore. He says the guy threatened to 
call the police and all this shit and Kip or Kit or whatever was like 
&quot;you’re gonna call the cops on me? You? Who’s the one cheating
on his wife
and kids and screwing some crack whore in a warehouse down by the
tracks?&quot;
Lessons on morality from the quarter-staff wielding gatekeeper of the
abandoned warehouse.

<h2>Sun Aug 26.</h2>

<h3>We Leave A Devastated Canada In Our Wake.</h3>

<p align=center>
<img WIDTH=171 HEIGHT=270 src="image/bcpicnic175.jpg">
<img WIDTH=426 HEIGHT=269 src="image/bcpicnic275.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Last day in Vancouver!  We were sad, but also tired.  We went to the
bike olympics, which were pretty slow by the time that we arrived,
but we got to see our
Canadian friends again.
<br>
Ten or so bikes started pulling a chariot around a track, which
aroused my
derby instincts.  I jumped on Plopulator and rammed the chariot from
behind, trying to spice up their ride.  I was only moving about 5 MPH
(approx. 8 KPH Canadian) faster
than it was, but they all stopped and asked each other if
everybody was all right until I went away.
</p>


<p>
There was not much left to do except thank the friendly Canadians and
leave.  We borrowed their velo-love stencil and spraypaint and
decorated most every item of clothes that we had with us, totally
saturating the stencil in the process.  We gave them some hash that we
were afraid to try and smuggle back, and started the drive home,
which completely sucked.  One car broke down twice over the course of
2 days.  Another car's axle broke, the wheel
popped off, and the sparks from the chassis scraping the freeway
started it on fire.  Everybody eventually got back OK, but we were all
sad because we had to live our normal lives in Portland
again, not getting drunk every day and riding together in Vancouver.
We joined up once we all got home and decompressed, counted off for the
last time (surely the last time that that particular combination of
riders will be together at once), shared a final Canadian beer, and moped
home.

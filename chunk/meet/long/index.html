<p>
A recumbent chopper with a relaxed fork angle, long wheelbase,
and low center of gravity makes for a very smooth ride despite the
stupid name, which has been kept for historical reasons.
With a large front wheel, Chopagator can slam straight into curbs and
roll right over them, but the urge to do this must be resisted,
because it puts too much stress on the frame and leads to frequent
repairs.

<h2 align=center>Plopulator Son Of Chopulator.</h2>

<p>
Chopigator has been lost, found, and lost again.  We got to missing
it, so Plopulator was built.  He was designed to be longer and
stronger than his predecessor.
</p>

Unfortunately, this has made him quite heavy, so while the frame is
solid, other parts don't hold up so well.  The headset bearing races
tended to crack, leading to play and stress at the headtube, smashed
bearings, and bent steertubes being replaced about once a year.
Then the headtube
itself flared at the ends.  At this point it was all over, since the
races wouldn't stay put in their sockets, leading to smashed bearings
and cracked races every few rides.
</p>

<p>
Eventually the front end was sawed off and replaced with a fork from a
    crashed minibike, heavy as anything and anchored at the top and
    the bottom.
</p>

<p>
Plopulator also tends to eat a rear wheel every six months.  Lashing a
    spare on the back wasn't a big deal, but good wheels were getting
    scarce.
This concern
has been addressed with the homemade mag wheel, which may or may not
    be a good idea.
    A real 26 inch mag wheel is a treasure that our
gleaners have vainly sought ever since we started welding too much
stuff onto our bikes.

<h2 align=center>The Family Truckster.</h2>

<p>
    When "Clark" visited us from New York City, he told us that he was
    having some money problems due to the high cost of living there.
    His solution was to build <b>The Family Truckster</b>, a bike with
    the capacity to cook and prepare burgers on the road (although
someone else riding alongside must flip any burgers cooking while in transit).
</p>

<table>
<tr>

<p>
For some reason, however, "Clark" failed to do better than break
even.  Standing in the street and harassing passersby didn't bring in
the sales.  Neither did banging on the windows of bars and showing the
patrons inside how much he was enjoying his own delicious juicy
burgers.  It was also detrimental to his business when we ate much of
his stock, and
then threatened to barf on the sidewalk unless he gave us five bucks.
</p>

<p>
"Clark" might have been disappointed, but the rest of us weren't.  We
once again had an opportunity to turn the streets of Portland into a
celebration of freedom from the Man.  Depressingly enough,
the act of hanging out on the sidewalk among a crowd is now illegal in
Portland due to the recently passed "Sit/Lie Ordinance", which was
clearly designed to be applied selectively to undesirable elements
such as bums and people who are having fun without spending lots of
money.

An early version of the Truckster was built in the mid nineties.
Unlike the Truckster, it didn't have the ability to cook while rolling
without roasting a certain amount of human flesh in the process.

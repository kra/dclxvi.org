<h1 align=center>Trikes.</h1>

<p>
Tricycles form the backbone of any extended activity.
Chunk is fortunate enough to have acquired two of them, code named
Trike and Keg Trike.  Their necessity is manifested in three ways.
</p>

<h2 align=center>Cargo Hauling.</h2>

<p>
The deeper we
push our quest for domination into the Forbidden Zone, the greater we
feel the effects of attrition.  The high radiation, combined with the
orgone 
flux produced by the wide-band chunkulation field, greatly amplify the
effects of entropy.  We also tend to make our journeys more interesting
by jousting and running into things.
</p>

<p>
These factors, coupled with the fact that Chunkcycles are crafted
using the cheapest materials and unsound construction techniques, mean
that we can expect our vehicles to lose functionality at any time. 
</p>

<p>
While we look
forward to this weeding-out process as an opportunity to pick up
scabs, it does imply that 
Chunk missions require quite a lot of supplies.  The
usual bicycle tools must be supplemented with a hammer, long pipe for
whacking things, anaesthetic, radiation pills, etc. etc..
</p>

<p align=center>

</p>

<p>
Even with these precautions,
our route can often be traced by
the trail of disabled bicycles locked up along the way.  The pilots
of downed vehicles are towed on skateboards, or become passengers on
padded racks, banana seats, or the back of Keg Trike.  In the darkest
hours, some of us
have had to resort to taking the bus home.
</p>

<p>
What happens when a pilot is killed in the line of duty?
We have very specific procedures; it makes us feel tough or something.
If we're on
a hill, we duct-tape the pilot to the steed, light them on fire, and
give them a Viking funeral.  If we're at the bottom of a gravity well,
we strip them both for parts and bury the remains in the nearest trench.
</p>


<h2 align=center>All-Terrain Reconnaissance.</h2>

<p align=center>

</p>

<p>
The Forbidden Zone is riddled with treacherous mutant-ridden cesspools
of radiation which must be fully explored and subdued.  Trikes, of
course, dominate these areas.  Trikes can go anywhere.  We have
ridden trikes down steep ice-and-slush covered hills; as long as the
pilot keeps the front wheel below the rear wheels, the machine will
stay upright.
</p>

We need to replace fallen pilots as well as fallen cycles.  This is
easy to do - we ride around the neighborhood and find kids who are
sick of their parents.  We take them to the Secret Hideout, fill them
with beer, and stick them on whichever bike is currently the
hardest to ride.  If they don't cause any serious damage to
themselves, we let them stick around.

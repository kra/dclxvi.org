<p>
There are quite a few worthy cycle manufacturers out there that are
not directly affiliated with Chunk.  We are quite willing to
provide space for images sent our way.

	Recumbents (and tandems) appear to be relatively easy to make
	from existing 
	bicycles, but hard to make well.  There are lots of exotic advantages
	that a recumbent can have, such as a low center of gravity, a
	short wheelbase, a long wheelbase, a fairing, or even a
	trunk.  Hard to incorporate with just a hacksaw and a torch.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Creative recumbent hackers simply stick the pedals forward to
	produce a reclining position.  This also keeps the pilot high off of
	the ground, which makes falling much more exciting.  It is also quite
	a thrill to ride a vehicle that puts the stem right between one's
	legs, just waiting to tangle with one's crotch.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This machine, constructed by Ms. Stout, is a front-wheel-drive
	recumbent, built to
	specifications much tighter than anything Chunk would care to produce.
	The drive
	train is attached to the fork, and the ride is surprisingly
	smooth.  While
	heavy pedaling does cause wobs that are more pronounced than on an
	upright, it is quite easy to sync with these movements, much like when
	pumping and tilting a bike when out of the saddle.  Take care to
	notice the built in co-pilot.

	This photograph was smuggled to us by one of our intelligence
	operatives.  All that we know is that the inventor is based in Canada.
	The vehicle pictured uses a rear-wheel drive, with two sets of
	pedals.  The front pedals are affixed to the head tube, and interact
	with the rear pedals via a long chain with an idler.  Apparently, this
	bicycle can be used as a tandem!  Ah, to cruise the streets at night,
	reclining against that backrest, fondling the body smushed to one's
	chest - truly, it must be a heavenly ride.

At last, a human powered drag racer!  That rear wheel is a racing
slick from an automotive drag racer which has been filled with solid
rubber instead of air.  Thus, it also functions as a flywheel.  The
racer starts cranking with the rear wheel jacked off of the ground.
Two or three
freewheels allow the pilot to get quite a spin going.
Once the highest gear is reached, a lever allows the
jack to be released, and the bike speeds off as soon as the wheel
touches ground.  The maiden voyage was reported to have lasted 15 feet
before the machine rolled, but luckily a roll cage and seatbelt are
incorporated in the design.
</p>

<p>
This image came from the album of Bikesmith's in Seattle, but they
don't know who this person is.  If you happen to be this person, or
know him, tell us and we'll get them in touch.  Val over there figured
out why it
couldn't stay upright, and it's obvious once one has seen it: the bike
isn't going to lean with that square rear slick.  In fact, it doesn't
really act like a singletrack vehicle at all.  Anyone who tries riding a
delta trike at speed, like this thing is, really, gets a lesson in
inertia and centripetal force when they steer the machine round a
corner and their body wants to keep going straight.  Also, keeping
balanced 
on the straight pretty much depends on a wide enough wheelbase, since
a trike can't be positioned or leaned under the rider's downward
force.  This thing is 
not only narrow, it forbids the occupant from hiking over.  Solution:
allow the vehicle to lean by either rounding that rear wheel, or
introducing some sort of pivot in the middle.  Or perhaps switch to a tadpole
trike, with the wide track of the large wheel in the front and a
vertical headtube, in which case that wheel might just keep
the ride upright by brute force.
</p>

<p>
Now, maybe rumors of this machine's deadliness were overrated, and
maybe it can be ridden by one with nerves of steel and lightning-quick
reflexes.  But maybe we'd all love to line up and congratulate such a
person, if one indeed exists.

Dear Chunk 666,
Thanks for the warning. I don't think your scheme for world domination 
will apply to NYC, however, as it's on a different reality level. This 
is best illustrated by the attached image. It's a Full-Kustom Chopper.
The forward cockpit is for the use of a large cat, a small dog, or a
humongous rat. Regards,

In order to impress us, choppers have to be, well, impressive.
There's just so many of them out there.  This one passes, although he

The Burningman festival, hooray.  Pay money to hang out in a parking
lot in the desert and either look at people acting like freaks or act
like a freak yourself and let people look at you.  Strange machines do
show up there, however.  If any of these devices help to clear the streets in local
Masses, one word will get us over there to provide an escort, as soon
as the blimp is completed.

Aaron reports: This vehicle required four people to operate, its
locomotion was
supplied through an assembly of bicycle cranks and sprockets. The main
turret spun via an electric motor which periodically functioned as a
flamethrower. An inspiration to all.  Liz also observed some people enjoying
themselves in it while it was parked on a street somewhere, and she
says that it has an onboard daquiri maker.

Another operative acquired this picture, and we only know what it shows
us: an upright piano motivated by six rear bicycle wheels, and
supported by three motorcycle or minibike wheels.  We want to believe
that that gibbet and disco ball are part of the vehicle, but they seem
to have disappeared from the second picture.

I had some time and I built myself a tallbike.  I based it on a freestyle
frame extending the front triangle 8.5 inches. This I did for comfort to
suit my height. I extended the front forks two feet and beefed up the
unicrown with an added center tube and a bridge and two short tubes
bracing between the bridge and the curves at the crown. The back of the
frame was jacked up two feet using another BMX frame.
The view is great,
a lot of curtains get shut as I am riding past! It's a little spooky
riding in snow when forward progress is slowed and the front wheel gets
that surfy feeling.

My bike taxi is
kind of a messy design.  I was asked to build it to carry
some friends around in a local downtown artists open day.  My scrap pile
and my bank account were quite limited, and so was my schedule.  I
should have used plain tubing or at least square tube, but at the advice
of a local welder I built the rear frame out of angle iron.  This might
have been sufficient if I hadn't settled for a triple trailing arm rear
'suspension'.  I had no quick way to make a rear drive axle, so I
decided to have a center rear drive wheel and build the seating area
like a side car that straddled both sides.  This rigid rear frame caused
problems with traction for the center drive wheel, so I made narrower
rear braces that allowed the frame to bend to allow the center wheel to
stay on the ground even on uneven road surfaces.  The bike works fine,
but the driver's high, forward position (on the first incarnation)
caused the frame to torsion unpredictably.  I brought the seat and
handlebars back and down to combat this, but it wasn't enough.  If I had
actually brought the seat back so far that you sat with the passengers,
the twisting could be completely controlled, and it would make for a
really wild ride.  I know this sort of from experience, because after
being disappointed when I rebuilt the taxi, I quickly hooked up some
rope steering and brakes and rode down a big hill, chariot style.  By
leaning the frame, you could make some pretty tricky maneuvers.

<a href="mailto:schmunk@owlnet.rice.edu">Philip Schmunk</a> made this
impressive longbike.  We've had problems welding load-bearing
extensions to headtubes that don't have other supports - a crappy join
that isn't mitered properly tends to buckle it.  Perhaps it helps to
keep the fork and bearings in the headtube, like on this bike.

<h1 align=center>Sensible Vehicles.</h1>

<p>
Some useful, relatively down-to-earth vehicles!  Believe it or don't!
The ideas for some of these rides came from
<em>The Fantastic Bicycles Book</em>
by Steven Lindholm.
</p>

<p>
There's something very comforting about hauling a lot of shit around.
It's nice to know that you're prepared for sudden hailstorms, famine,
breakdowns, and boredom.  With these large vehicles, we are also
working
towards our goal of building self-sustaining, mobile arks that can
withstand several extremes of terrain and climate.  While we have some
ways to go, these crafts are already very homey, supporting a
small but permanent ecology of spiders both when parked and in
transit.  When docked in the driveway under a tarp, they house and are
guarded by the local kittys.

<p>
The Hack is a pretty normal sidecar bike made out of two frames, most of
another, and a little of a fourth, with some random bike tubing and
chainstays connecting it all together.  It's made for hauling
honored passengers around with style and dignity, and does so pretty
damn well, if we say so ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Because of the Hack's asymmetry, pedaling it can be exciting for the
drover.
When there isn't any weight in
the sidecar, this vehicle has a great right turn and a terrible left
turn.
Standard procedure when without a passenger is to put
something heavy in the sidecar and jettison it later.
</p>

<p>
Putting the sidecar on the left, by the way, was a stupid move here
where we ride on the right.  Not only is it impolite to subject
the passenger to passing traffic, but highly crowned roads are more
difficult to navigate without support from the sidecar, since the
trike leans with the road.  Oh well.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The device is slowly growing
umbrellas as they are found and clamped onto the frame.  These impair
visibility to the rear, and can make things exciting during high
winds, but the extra weight lends some stability, and they make
raincoats unneccessary!  A padded chair,
refreshments under the seat, a reading light, enough stability to
safely convey at least five kids - it all makes for a great ride, but
to get around in the rain without needing a raincoat is the
ultimate in luxury pedaling.

        The Hack's gentle ride also proves useful when someone isn't
        quite feeling up pedaling their own bike.

<p>
The Fishmobile was meant to be a Jakarta style rickshaw, where the
passenger sits in between the two front wheels.  That huge box wasn't
really suited for a seated rider, though, so it was more of a stuff
hauler than a people hauler.  Then again, it never got walls or guards
to keep stuff out of the spokes, so was really
more of a
Popemobile than anything else.
</p>

<p align=center>
<a href="image/hires/fishmonger150.jpg"><img WIDTH=458 HEIGHT=295 src="image/fishmonger75.jpg"></a>
</p>

<p>
This condition lasted for about two years, until
I needed a costume for the Halloween Critical Mass ride, and
turned it into the Fishmobile.
</p>

<p>
The head of the Fishmobile is mostly plywood, and the tail and shanks
are coroplast and random junk.  Before the fishy exoskeleton was
added, it really rode like crap without anything to weight the
front wheels.  Due to sloppy construction, the headtube leans back about one
degree from vertical, which makes the frame want to lean a little in
the wrong direction 
when the handlebars are turned.  Also, the box is attached near the
wheels and up at the handlebars, and since it is a somewhat tall
trike, there's a lot of torque on the front section.  This made it
hard to keep both front wheels on the ground when the box was
unloaded.  The fish head
adds a lot of weight to the front, and makes it pretty easy to ride,
so long as the pedaler has eaten a large breakfast and isn't in a hurry.

The Platform Thing, while still a work in progress, is my
pride and joy.  It's a reversed trike with a large tiller which
consists of a pipe stuck onto a pair of handlebars, with a front
saddle used as a horn to give the pilot something to hang on to.  A
proper steering situation is planned, but the thing rides, so it's being
ridden.
It's an upright,
which produces a lot of flex on that rearmost girl's bike.  Bikes
weren't made to withstand twists while their front sections are held
rigid!  It's going to be a recumbent, with the pilot's butt where the
knees are now and the currently used cranks acting as an idler/gearing
wheel for the currently unused front cranks, but the thing rides,
so...  It's going to have a platform in front large enough for an
exotic dancer and a tiger.  It's going to have a little more metal and
a lot more wood.  It's going to have a canopy and a smuggling
compartment and a prow, just wait and see.

		With the current temporary configuration, the Platform Thing
		can be used as

		steering and the rearmost taking care of the pedaling.  Note the

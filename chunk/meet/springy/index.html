Vlad the Impaler, the first intentionally springy bike of the fleet.
Somewhat hard to mount, because one had to climb in the middle and
wedge one's face in the handlebars - which ended in clobberingly
beautiful knobs - before gaining enough momentum to
assume the laid-back riding position and get some space.  Nowadays,
Vlad spends his time rusting in the chronic pile.

<h2 align=center>Bendy.</h2>

		<p>
		Bendy, designed and constructed by Big B., is yet another ride that
		nobody but he can handle.  Because Big B. can ride anything, he
		rides everything, and because he rides everything, he has put his body
		through the wringer of wheeled torture devices.  Bike riding becomes
		too painful for most people when they get scabs where Big B. gets them,
		and most people take a break for a while.  Not Big B.  He does
		have a modicum
		of sense, however, and has turned his attentions towards designing
		cushier bikes such as Bendy.  The only interface between
		flesh and metal not mediated by a spring is the pedals.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since Bendy is more complex than most rides, it has undergone
        more continuous research and modification than the rest.  At
        first, Bendy's stem was half spring.  This
		required Big B. to use foresight in turning, inputting maneuvers a
		moment before they are to be executed, and oversteering and correcting
		often.  When observing his riding style, one was quickly impressed by
		the way that his body remained steady and upright while the bike swayed
		from side to side.  Bendy was soon rebuilt with a
        mumble-linkage suspension design that Big B. implemented after
        staring at an old motorcycle for a long time, and extra
        large handlebars for that springy feeling that only
        overextended thin metal tubes can give.  Nowadays, Bendy can
        also be found rusting in the chronic pile.

<h2 align=center>The Pogocyclething.</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
For Big B's latest, he used a pogo stick for the fork.  That and his
suspended drink holder ensures that he never spills a drop.  The
Pogocyclething was stolen before it could be thrown in the chronic pile.

<p>
And then, Thud made Sproing, the most advanced suspended bicycle ever
created.  It's a simple design, two springs in the middle of the
frame.  Unless the perfect balancing point is found, riding Sproing
feels like holding the bike together with your body.
</p>

<p>
Because Sproing has no hinges, only springs, it absorbs punishment,
bouncing around after a crash long after its thrown rider has stopped
rolling.  For this reason, Sproing will never, never rust away the
years in the chronic pile.

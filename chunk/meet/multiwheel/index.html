This ride is all about comfort and convenience.  Our bi/tri-cycle
technology makes worrying about how far back that wheelie can be
popped nothing but a sad memory.  Moreover, it also nearly eliminates the need to
steer.  One need only point the helm towards one's objective, pop
back, and relax.

<p>
Denk's brainchild the Co-Operator was created to promote love and
interactivity within the ranks of Chunk 666.  Cyclists tend to be
individualists, and cyclists on fucked-up bikes tend to be fucked-up
individualists.  The design of the Co-Operator requires her twin
pilots to simply work together or else.  She's a sociable
tandem tricycle with one long pair of handlebars.  Each rear wheel is
powered and braked by the pilot above it.  Unlike what most people
expect, this
has no effect on the steering.  In fact, often one one crank must
provide all of the motivation when the frame flexes and the other
chain falls off.  What other human powered vehicles are there that can
be repaired without stopping or having a crewmember go EVA?

<p>
While we learned after the fact that the Co-Operator bears a surprising
resemblance to the
<a href="http://www.worksman.com/p22.html">Worksman Dual Trike</a>,
our version trades the Worksman ethic of bombproofness for our own
need for lush excitement.
Don't tell Denk, but this vehicle is an utter piece of shit.  She used
to be a quadracycle, but the outrigger fell off.  After that, we had
to correct a list to port by using a larger wheel on that side.
This produces a smaller list to starboard which is counteracted by
putting the heavier crewmember on the other side.  There's about five
and a half dead bikes in this thing, and for a long development period
its mass would increase after every ride as we found a weak point
(when it bent) and
buttressed it with more metal.  Ah, but who the hell cares?  Love,
that's what it's all about, and even if the Co-Operator's riders
aren't skipping off to do it in the bushes, they at least know that
they won't leave each other behind if there's a breakdown.

        <p>
        Unfortunately, entropy will never be kind to such a large
        misaligned vehicle subject to the cruel torques of multiple
        independent drivetrains, and the Co-Operator is no exception.
        She has been been twisted into a mangled inert wreck several
        times.  Each time she has been mostly straightened out, and
        areas that couldn't be completely rehabilitated were lopped
        off and replaced with others.  The most recent iteration of
        this torturous cycle of rebirth has resulted in the
        <strong>The Gynecological Station</strong>, and we can only
        hope that this one will suffer a quick death and be reborn no
        more.

<h2 align=center>The Dog of War.</h2>

<p>
Holy shit!  It took Vog the Smeltor several nights without sleep to
craft the Dog, the juggernaut of battle wagons.  The rumble
of its bare iron wheels strikes fear in the hearts of enemies and friends
alike as it lumbers unstoppably forward (no brakes), crushing all who are
foolish enough to stand in its path.  Or at least, that was what
happened for the mile or so that we were able to keep this thing
moving.  It turns surprisingly well for a fixed-gear trike with no
differential.  The rear axle is a huge pipe sleeved inside another,
with grease ports to keep it from freezing up in the rain, and the
chainrings and picnic tables - er, wheels - are welded directly to the
axle.

		<h2 align=center>The Stupid Tadpole Trike.</h2>
		<p>
		This one was designed by someone who didn't bother to do a
		little experimentation before heating up the torch.  Hint:
		on a reversed trike with a non-vertical head tube, watch how
		the frame leans when the handlebars are turned.
		It can be
		ridden, but only Big Bear can ride it for any distance, and
		that's just because Big Bear can ride anything.  Basically,
		one of the front wheels is always off of the ground, and
		whichever one it is, it will be down and the other one will be up
		a moment later.

		Marsden apparently created this (somewhat) talltrike so that
		the epitome of Chunkstyle construction would be made flesh
		in its steering linkage made up of various cranks, pedals, and
		bolts, and its wheels of three different sizes.  The ballast module in
		the center is a busted small engine which currently leaves an
		oil slick behind.

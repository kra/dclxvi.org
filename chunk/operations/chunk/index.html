		The social structure of C.H.U.N.K. 666 is a cross between a grade-school
		playground and a troop of monkeys.  The pecking order is always
		changing, and is usually
		determined by constant little skirmishes, both on the road and in the
		lab.  This can take its toll on bicycles as well as humans, however,
		so we provide two escape valves - the Chunkathalon, where the
		mightiest are determined through competition, and the Rink,
		during which we just chill out, ride friendly-like in circles,
        and dance.

		The most important of our contests is the Master Cylinder Lap.
		Contestants must catch up with Hoss in the Keg Trike, which is
		loaded with tallboys of the cheapest beer available at the
        moment.
        The rider who first completes a lap with an empty can without
        spilling a drop is declared the winner.

        During the Golden Age, this
        was the 40 lap, but people today are less mighty than the
        ancestors.
        After a few repetitions, contestants usually have
        difficulties staying
        on the track.  Balances deteriorate, and body-checking
        becomes the most
        effective tactic.

        Sometimes, the pretense of
        going around the
        track is abandoned completely, and the event turns into the Master
        Cylinder Brawl.

<p>
We hold many jousting tournaments in keeping with the traditions of
our ancestors.  There are many ways to go about bringing this ancient
contest into the modern age.  The best lances are made out of somewhat
flexible PVC pipe - it should be easier to hit your opponent than to
take a hit.  The more flexible lances shown below make it a little harder,
because their wielders must continue to aim them after contact has been
made, leading to balance and entanglement issues.

        When we were to provide entertainment for some messenger
        invitational on Mt. Tabor, however, Thud made lances out of
        four foot 2-by-4s with some padding on the ends.  This changes
        the sport completely, turning it into a contest of who can
        take the most battering.  We are uncertain which end of the
        lance it is better to be at during a solid hit.

        The battle between Little Big Man and Plopulator Son Of
        Chopigator at right isn't quite authentic, by the way.
        Plopulator is a low, stable, heavy beast with a backrest, which
        gives it an unfair advantage in the joust, especially against
        a tallbike.  Eventually we did away with the lances altogether
        and just had Plopulator's pilot receive kicks to the chest,
        which still caused more falls for the opposing party.

        Unlike the joust, our re- and pre-enactments of great battles
        of the past and future are scripted events, but they are
        equally hazardous for their participants.

And of course there is always the jumping off of stuff, at which Silken
Thomas is the best.

At the Rink, on the other hand, things are calmer.  Everyone just
rides in the same direction and tries out the bikes.  So long as
nobody looks directly at the disco ball, collisions are rare.  We'll
light a few bonfires, the Flaming Bikes of Deth will do some laps
to make things warm, and people keep dancing even when it starts to
drizzle.

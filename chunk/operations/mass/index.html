As it is the last Friday of the month, I spend some time
contemplatively drinking a beer and repairing last night's damage to
my ride in preparation for the mighty Critical Mass.  The efforts
complete, I mount my steed and ride towards the gathering point, only
to be reminded that I forgot to fix that rusty brake that won't
release its death grip on my rim.  No matter, I anticipated a setback
such as this, and have alloted the time necessary to smack the
offending component around and lube the shit out of it.  Once again I
am awheel, and as the gathering point draws near I encounter my
comrades on their own choppers, tallbikes, and battlewagons.  We hail
and are well met, becoming one clot among the many converging from all
directions towards the shelter of the Burnside bridge, traditional
meeting place for massing cyclists since the days of yore.
Pedestrians and motorists mistake us for the Critical Mass ride
itself, and we wave to them cheerfully, for it does not matter;
whenever two or more cyclists are gathered in its name, there Critical
Mass will be among them.  In fact, nuts to the ride, perhaps we should
ditch it and derby in the park tonight?  The idea is debated back and
forth with volleys of shouts as we ply the streets, but no, our
destination does not change - we wish to be with our people, the
people of the wheel.  And as we come within sight of the milling
throng, we are glad that we stuck with the plan, because there they
are: the crusties on their barely functioning found bicycles, the
technogeeks on their expensive yuppie rides, the nerdy guy with the
basket bike, the clever mechanic, that one messenger, the shy kid, the
loudmouth old dude, the ordinary people who just like to ride the
mass.  They're all there, and we love them all, even if we don't like
a lot of them.  The socializing ends and the ride begins as we take to
the streets once more, and wherever we go, we own.  Better yet, we
give it freely back minutes later.  Is it our fault that the drivers
following us can't think of anything better to do with it than what
they've been doing every day?  We've made our mark.  People around us
have seen it, and that's swell, but it isn't really important, after
all.  What is important is that we can feel the mark within ourselves.
Critical Mass is a part of of us.  When the ride is done, we will
still own the streets every other day of the month, and we are still a
part of the community of massers, until the month rolls around and it
is time to ride together again.

  <dt><strong>May Day 1998.</strong></dt>
  <dd><p>Chunkathlon and late night rink.  Damage
	  was minimal.  The Swan broke <strong>again</strong>, and thus has
	  still not survived a single ride.  Vlad lost some essential parts.
	  The Cooperator was finally totalled beyond reasonable repair.  Angry
	  trog villagers caused more damage to humans: John Krack suffered a
	  bottle rocket down the back of the neck, a few days of tinnitus.
	  L.C. hit in the head with a raw potato and several raw eggs.  Kansas
	  smacked in the eye with a raw egg, shell fragments take him out of
	  commission for the weekend.  Despite casualties, we let the kids ride
	  the remaining bikes while we cool our heels.  At this point Chopagator
	  disappears.  Recommend we re-evaluate any activities which entail the
	  possibility of sensitive technology falling into unknown hands.
	  </p></dd>
	  
  <dt><strong>May 1998.</strong></dt>
  <dd><p>Denk reports that she was out for a ride when she
	  encountered an unknown individual riding Chopagator in SE Portland.
	  She states that this
	  individual was spitting on the fork (?!) and that he claimed that
	  the bike was given to him by his neighbor.
	  Individual
	  continued in a
	  southerly direction.  When asked why she did not apprehend the man,
	  she claimed that she was in a &quot;bad mood&quot;.  This agent has no
	  recommendations regarding this incident due to the fact that Denk
	  certainly does not go easy on <strong>him</strong> when in one
	  of her moods.
	  </p></dd>
	  
  <dt><strong>Late May 1998.</strong></dt>
  <dd><p>Someone tells John Krack that he saw some people with a
	  collection of
	  choppers at a house.  Krack investigates and observes that these bikes
	  are not of our manufacture, and appear to have been constructed on
	  site.
	  </p></dd>
	  
  <dt><strong>June 6 1998.</strong></dt>
  <dd><p>Recovery mission launched.  Team travels to point of
	  last sighting and wanders from there.  Encounters crowd of Russian BMX
	  kids and scares them off while attempting to make friends and gain
	  information.  Team journeys to house previously observed by John
	  Krack and mills
	  around in front honking horns until someone comes out.  Bike-maker is
	  not home but contact is made with his mom, who says that the boy rides
	  around with a trailer and collects scrap metal for his construction
	  projects.  Just before returning to the shack,
	  Baby's seat pops off yet again, dropping Loose Nuts onto the rear
	  wheel, which immediately slams him forward until his personal private
	  parts are rammed into the seatpost and sucked between the tire and frame.
	  L.N.'s reaction indicates that this is even less pleasant that it
	  sounds, and that his name now refers to more than his laziness with the
	  wrench.  After a nice little rest, he is given extra padding but
	  still has a tender ride home.
	  Recommendation: we can't take much more of this.  Morale is low and
	  we're obviously being picked off one by one.
	  </p></dd>
	  
  <dt><strong>June 7 1998.</strong></dt>
  <dd><p>Jeff Wonderful reports that he saw Chopagator leaving
	  the Powerhouse the night before, and that the rider said something
	  unintelligible after Jeff yelled &quot;That's C.H.U.N.K. 666's bike!&quot;
	  </p></dd>
	  
  <dt><strong>June 8 1998.</strong></dt>
  <dd><p>Megulon-5 checks in at his day job in
	  downtown Portland.  During an idle gaze out of the window he spies
	  Chopagator parked across the street!  Grabs U-lock, races down stairs,
	  and then becomes cautious; stashes U-lock in pants and mills around
	  aimlessly, imitating a random bystander.  After fifteen minutes it is
	  obvious that the bikenapper is not in the immediate area, so the
	  U-lock is used to doubly secure it to the rack that it is locked to.
	  The current lock is a rather dinky chain, so the situation isn't quite
	  a Mexican standoff, but a note is left with a phone number anyway;
	  lock-busting is best avoided when possible.  A call is received
	  shortly afterwards.  Approximate transcript follows.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  &quot;I found a lock on my bike...&quot;<br>
	  &quot;<em>your</em> bike?!&quot;<br>
	  &quot;yeah, well, sorry about that.  I took my lock off.&quot; <br>
	  &quot;Where did you get that bike?&quot;<br>
	  &quot;I bought it off of this guy on the street, I thought that it was
	  Chopagator.&quot;<br>
	  &quot;It <em>is</em> Chopagator.&quot;<br>
	  &quot;Well, I paid $40 for it, maybe I could get $20 from
	  you...&quot;<br>
	  &quot;You want <em>me</em> to pay <em>you</em> for <em>my</em> stolen
	  bike?&quot;<br>
	  &quot;Ok, whatever.&quot;<br>
	  &quot;You knew it was Chopagator but you still bought it?&quot;<br>
	  &quot;Um, sorry.&quot;<br>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Recommendation: Some quicker thinking during the conversation would
	  have been helpful - we still do not know whether this was the
	  individual that Denk encountered, or who the seller was, assuming that
	  this story is true.  The level of assholism that this guy possesses is
	  still in question as well.  He did treat the bike well, and somebody
	  down the line gave it a nice duct-tape-and-bubble-wrap backrest, a
	  foam
	  cushion, and a front wheel with an aluminum rim (which was immediately
	  delegated to a bike that has a front brake and takes less frontal 
damage).  On the 
other hand, he knew who we were and some of our jargon, so he could have
found us without much trouble, yet he didn't even claim that he had
tried to do so.  Dude, if you're reading this, what's the story?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it doesn't really matter, we have Chopagator
back.  It appears that our theory is correct: if our bikes
are stolen but continue to be ridden in Portland, we'll eventually
find them.  We should also continue to treat Megulon-5 in the
re-evolution tanks.  His position provides valuable insight
into the inner workings of Portland's elite power cabal, and gives
us access to a
prime downtown observation post.

<h1 align=center>The Night Delivery.</h1>

<p>
One of the most rewarding aspects of our domination of the neighborhood
is that whenever a critical mission must be carried out, C.H.U.N.K. 666 is
immediately summoned.  If the mission promises a sizable reward, or at
least an opportunity to F.U.S., we are sure to take it on.
</p>

<p>
Such a mission was <strong>The Night Delivery</strong>.  It was Denk's
birthday, and, as usual, the local deities had to be convinced that
she should be allowed yet another year of being alive.  A celebration
was necessary, requiring the usual refreshment module.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the celebration location was across town from the
underground beer stockpile.  The fluids had to be transported across
the Forbidden Zone and past the rabble of beer-craving mutants.

The cargo vehicle was, of course, Keg Trike, piloted by Hoss, our
most loyal and reliable beast of burden.  Unfortunately, Hoss had
recently been doing quite a bit of cargo hauling, and had been
exposed to enough radioactivity to reduce a normal human into a
smoldering lump.  He wouldn't hear of letting anyone else carry this
load, however, and incapacitated Kl&#246;ven H&#246;&#246;f when we
hinted that he
might do the job better.  What a gentleman!  We relented after we
found this beautiful radiation suit for him to wear.

Finally, Denk herself rode point on the Cactus Flower, a chopper of
her own creation, and kept an eye
on us to make sure that we didn't tap the keg before we arrived.

Keg Trike is shown here outside of the hangar in its pre-launch
position.  The weight of the pilot is necessary for the front wheel of
the vehicle to touch down.

This attribute became a feature when, not one block after takeoff,
the head tube of Keg Trike snapped clear through!  Auto-wheelie
instantly commenced,
followed by rapid deceleration as Hoss found himself sitting behind
his steed with the handlebars in his hands.  Although natural
component failure was the obvious cause (something like this
happens almost every ride), the nature of our mission forced us to
assume that foul play was involved, and we instantly snapped into
defensive positions.  Hoss pushed Keg Trike to safety as
Denk monitored the perimeter.

   A rider zipped back to base and somehow found a replacement stem and
   wheel with an intact tire, but the outlook looked grim until the
   Streetsweeper pulled out the Stash Bag.  In this pouch is kept the
   collected small hardware of generations of departed bikes.  Headset
   parts were found that fit, at least to Chunk specifications.

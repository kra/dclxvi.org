<h1 align=center>The 2002 Chopper Construction Workshop.</h1>

<p>
In August of 2002 we invited the people of Portland to a chopper
construction workshop.

        Preparations for the workshop began months in advance as we built up
        the pile.  We consolidated piles from several chunkyards
        around town, and
        scrounged bikes and parts, especially precious rear wheels, from the
        Community Cycling Center dumpster and Citybikes freebin.  Many
        participants brought supplies of their own, amassing a beautiful load
        of crap that was soon spread all over the street.

The workshop began with a short lecture.  It started with basic
physics and cycle handling, and continued with planning and assembly
techniques, hack mitering, ways to stick stuff
together that tend to result in stronger joins, and the all-important
rules of project triage and planning around the available parts to be
scrounged from the pile.
</p>
<p>
Testing probably wasn't stressed enough, because some
people spent hours getting everything working
on a bike that folded like a book as soon as it was ridden.

        We had four oxy-acetylene rigs and one MIG welder working
        simultaneously.  Vog the Smeltor worked a torch all day.

People made bikes for their children or, if they were a little young
still, rode them around to get them hooked.

        This kept us busy, however, running around and sticking
        goggles on kids or moving them away from dangerous situations.

        The street was turned into a sketchy bike construction and destruction
        area.  We combed through the detritus in the gutters for days
        afterwards and
        skimmed out many small parts that can be hard to find in a pinch.

        Hours went by.  Bikes were built, broken, and rebuilt.  People
        wore out and went home, or stayed anyways in dogged pursuit of
        their dream choppers.
        The sun set.
        Food was cooked and eaten among the twisted metal.  Eventually
        we called it a night, and went for a ride.  A few more
        mutated bikes now roll down the streets of Portland.

<h1>Riding During Wartime.</h1>

<span class="twotext">
What sort of image are we promoting here?  Why the armor, the
formations, the burning and the crashing?  Why the jousting, the
derbying, the taunting, the swiping?

Maybe these questions shouldn't be very interesting, and maybe we
shouldn't need a reason.
Today, unfortunately, we are living in an extremely fucked world.  Our
country is at war in the middle east, and in fact has been at war
there since we were children.  It will continue for the
foreseeable future.  The current wars are just a
somewhat more violent episode in this terrible teevee movie.
</p>
<p>
So let us remember that we have it easy.  When we scrape our knees we
can clean them off and not die of an infection because
we've been bombed into a sewer, and when we get dragged to the
hospital after breaking a bone we don't get turned away because it's
overflowing with people full of shrapnel.  We can do these things
because we're paying for the guns, and therefore they're usually being
pointed at someone else.

The state of the world should cause some examination of our
mission and methods.  Does the blanket of stupidity that we spread
wherever we go trivialize the carpet bombs that our armies are
dropping elsewhere?  Should we be teaching the children how to play
peacefully instead of demonstrating how to make scabs?
</p>
<p>
I personally believe that in the face of how fucked the world is, we
should continue to ride our bikes drunk into the streets and crash
into shit.  While C.H.U.N.K. 666 was formed to assure our survival in
a post-apocalyptic, post-petroleum future, it is not a political
entity, and our members have differing opinions about oil and
wars.  This being said, we should all be able to agree that this
moronic world must be given the moronic response that it deserves.

We invite you to join us, wherever you are.  Keep up the sham of
normalcy for part of the week if you must.  Go to work, pay taxes, and
wear pants.  But please, for one day a week, or one day a month, or
even one day only if that's all you have the courage for, stop
pretending.  Take to the streets, alone or with friends, drunk or
sober, rowdy or peaceful, and do something that will reveal how stupid
this whole scam really is.

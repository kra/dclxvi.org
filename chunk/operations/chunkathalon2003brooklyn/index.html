<p>
In August of 2003 we traveled to Brooklyn to visit our companions who
had settled there.  Our excuse was that we would bring the
Chunkathlon to the East in a sort of gesture of cultural goodwill.
</p>

<p>
After scouting the city and drinking the local beer on the local
bridges, we secured an excellent location, a concrete
pad on the Brooklyn waterfront, elevated about five feet and
surrounded by brush, dumped hazardous waste, and
C.H.U.D. nests.  It was littered with broken glass, odd detrius, and
poos.  At the time it was an unofficial park,
although the police came by often to chase people away.  It was owned
by the state, and rumor
has it that it will be turned into a nice clean safe and legal park
some day.  Spidey was able to get permission to use it from an
official who was actually excited that this blasted wasteland was
being put to a good use.
</p>

<p>
We rode out there with brooms and shovels a few times and cleaned away
the needles and most of the debris that was large enough to gouge out
an eye, while leaving plenty of smaller glass shards and turds.
While we were sweeping the place one day some cops showed up and tried
to kick us out.  We told them that we had permission
to use the place from the owner, but they weren't able to figure out
how to verify
that.  Eventually they just turned around mid-sentence and walked
away, not happy with letting us clean an abandoned industrial site but
apparently realizing how silly it would be to stop us.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it was a great site, a flat surface complete with confusing
obstacles, including baby carriages, many tires, and what was
apparently the remains of a re-enactment of the 1862 battle between
the C.S.S. Merrimac and the U.S.S. Monitor,
two ironclads represented by refrigerators with
wheels bolted onto them.
We put up a scaffold for the judges,
reconstituted CJ, our MC, and stared back at people
until we were ready to begin.  </p>

<p>
Some local bike freaks and geeks came, including random
tallbikers, couriers on bikes weird enough to be considered
mutant bikes, Richmond Zoobombers, and the Easyfellas, who
fired up a barbecue in front of their lowrider-style tallbikes.
Two riders arrived from S.C.U.L. in Boston, one on a
hand-cranked trike and another barefoot on a fixed-gear chopper.  This
was a very bad place to be barefoot, with all the needles and
poo-smeared glass -  - we
hope that you didn't get hepatitis, Snarly.
Also attending were three kids who had followed us the
whole way to the event, popping wheelies and crashing into us.  We
couldn't prevent them from becoming the course marshals, because they
would set up the events up before we could
stop them, so we deputized them once they were able to promise that they were
over thirteen years old with a straight face.
</p>

<p>
The Brooklyn chapter of the Black Label Bike Club was there too, of
course.  They clumped on one end of
the field in their black denim colors, and we milled around on the
other in our gay space pirate uniforms.  This was the first time that
we had really met.  What would happen?  Who was going to go on a beer
run?

        The Master Cylinder Lap is our traditional first event.  We've scaled
        it down over the years
        from the 40 Lap to avoid turning it into a beer chugging
        competition, but we've also kept it because it's a good way to lube
        the riders up.  Contestants must ride a lap and finish their
        tallboy.  Drinking when not rolling is illegal.

        The winner was Ninja.

The baby rescue is an important event for us.  It demonstrates the
eternal battle between good and evil, and the difficulty of telling
which side is which, or even what side one is fighting for.  In this
competition, one rider
must rescue the baby, and the other must prevent that rescue from
happening.

        These three photos show an exciting match.
        Nurple starts by pulling ahead, popping a wheelie, and
        swerving in front of Jake.  In the second picture, it
        is Jake's rear wheel which is off of the ground after Nurple has
        set his fork down on top of Jake's.  Both contestants
        are being ejected from their bikes, but the third photo shows
        that Jake was thrown too far, while Nurple tumbled towards the
        baby - losing his pants, yes, but the only thing that matters
        is rescuing that baby.  Save the baby, Nurple.

        There are a few rules, though - no kicking, no punching, no sticks in
        spokes, etc., although checking, shouldering, elbowing, and anything
        else that keeps the hands on the bars and the feet on the pedals is
        legal.  In practice, so long as nobody really fucks anybody up, it's
        all allowed, because some things are just too hard to avoid.  Above,
        I am caught taking out both Thud and Krack with a single well-placed
        gentle nudge.  Who could
        resist such an opportunity?

        Hucking stuff at someone's head should definitely be
        considered unsporting,
        however.  This is also impossible to prevent because on the
        second and subsequent rounds, the onlookers get all fired up
        and start throwing whatever is around and screeching and
        pounding their chests.  There were many obstacles to
        avoid.  Silken threw a television set at my shin, which
        was luckily well armored.

        One interesting hazard was a tractor tire that we had pulled
        out of a stagnant pool.  During one round, I shrugged this off
        to the cheers of the crowd after somebody rolled it into
        me.  Later, I saw it coming at me and again prepared to
        push it aside - but this time, it was much heavier and
        knocked me over, because it was occupied.  The man inside was
        Jason Meggs, who was once arrested for riding across the San
        Francisco Bay Bridge.

        Nurple was the first contender, and he
        stayed up for at least five rounds.  The judges told him to
        get another bike at that point - tall choppers are very good
        at jousting when the rear wheel is a few inches farther behind
        the seat than on a standard tallbike.  He kept on winning,
        though.

      We introduced this incredibly stupid event to the mutant biking
      gladiatorial community in 2002.  A rope is tied to each of two
      contestants, who ride towards and past each other.  The winner is the
      one who
      travels the farthest, or longest, or pukes up the fewest internal organs.
      This year, it lasted about five rounds before Doyle
      competed and the rope snapped his opponent cleanly in half.

        We ended the evening with another sight that the residents of
        Brooklyn were apparently not prepared for, the Historical
        Re-Enactment.  People were jumping off of the platform into
        piles of junkie leftovers, but nobody was shot by overzealous
        national guardsmen.

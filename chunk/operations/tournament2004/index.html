<h1 align=center>The Organ Donor Invitational.</h1>

<p>
Celebrate the birthday of the Organ Donor at the <strong>Organ Donor
Invitational Tall-Bike Pub-Crawl</strong> and the <strong>Organ Donor Invitational
Tallbike Jousting Tournament</strong>!  This ancient tallbike, the
second or third bike created by C.H.U.N.K. 666, has amazingly survived
ELEVEN YEARS on the streets and in the rusting pile, despite the fact
that it was made by unskilled welders from an inferior design!
Join 
CHUNK 666 for a weekend of libations, toasts, riding really tall bicycles, 
song, human sacrifice, tallbike jousting & organ donation in celebration of 
the Organ Donor's spunky will to perservere through adversity, drunk riders, 
& rust, Rust, RUST!!!
</p>

<p>
The <strong>Organ Donor Invitational Tall-Bike Pub-Crawl</strong> will occur on
Friday, April 23rd, 2004.  The first stop will be the Bar of the Gods
on S.E. Hawthorne St. at 9 PM, and the third stop will be the Basement Pub
on S.E. 12th Ave. at 11 PM.  Contestants may register for the joust during
the crawl.
The Organ Donor will be in attendance so bring your cash to buy the birthday 
boy a beer & bring your singing voice for several rousing verses of "Happy 
Birthday!"
</p>

<p>
The <strong>Organ Donor Invitational Tallbike Jousting Tournament</strong> will take
place at Col. Summers' Park, S.E. 21st and Belmont, Portland.
Registration starts at noon, jousting begins at 2 PM.
Prepare for [bracketed] madness as CHUNK 666 defends Portland's sacred 
traditions of inebriety & loose morals from marauding rival bike gangs & 
modern-day puritans the DEAD BABY BIKE CLUB (Seattle) & HEAVY PEDAL 
CYCLECIDE (San Francisco) in the ancient tradition of the tilt! Grown men 
will weep, women will wail, & small children will howl with glee as these 
modern-day practicioners of Heavy Velo-Cavalry crash. Organ Donor is 
scheduled to preside over the festitivies as a Special Guest Judge, holding 
the tie-breaking vote, like the Vice-President.
Afterwards, ride with CHUNK 666 & the other decimated survivors to a Victory 
Velo-Vahalla party
(location TBA).
</p>

<h2 align=center>Registration.</h2>

<p>
Slots will be limited, and contestants are encouraged to register
on the 23rd.
All contestants must have tallbike in hand to register.  Tallbikes
must conform to the Organ Donor Standard of Excellence.  The wheelbase
must be that of a standard adult bicycle.  The seat height must be roughly
the shoulder height of the contestant.  The horizontal distance between
the rear hub and the seat
must not be greater than a few inches.  In other words,
the bike must approximate the proportions of a standard double-stack
tallbike (one bike on top of the other).  Note that the actual
method used to construct the tallbike is irrelevant, so long as these
proportions are met; for example, the Organ Donor itself is not made
in this way.  Direct any questions to
<a href="mailto:megulon5@dclxvi.org">megulon5@dclxvi.org</a>.
</p>


<p>
These rules are intended to prevent people from trying to joust on their big
brother's ten speed, and exclude bikes which give an unfair advantage due
to their long wheelbase and stability.  The Registrar will have the
final say in interpreting these and any other rules.

> I noticed your descriptions of the "world's tallest
> bicycle"

Ah, yes.  The "World's Tallest Bike" (as the Black
Label Bike Club has dubbed it) was built by Per, the
founder and former President of that club.  It is six
frames high with an extended wheelbase.  It measures
12'6" to the seat, which you will note is six inches
taller than Atomic Zombie's "Tallest Bike In The
World" (Skycycle II) and a good foot taller than the
currently recognized tallest bike by Guiness's
standards.  Unfortunately, the bike is only ridden one
day a year:  the Minneapolis May Day parade.  However,
during that ride it does travel several miles.

The rest of the year, the bike becomes a bike rack in
back of the BLBC house.  It is usually ridden by
Strange, who claims to be the inventor of "Bridge
Rash".  As far as I know, only one other person has
ridden it, the Scallywag's "Lil' Phil".  In its
original configuration the bike tended to sway left
and right like a tree in the wind, with the addition
of the airline cabling the bike merely twists about
its center like a wiggly dog.

> I'm personally not very interested in who's bike is
> the very tallest

Me neither, it seems to me that exaggerated dimensions
are a very uncreative way to take a bike, and that any
bike worth building is one that you can get around
town on.  I'd prefer that bikes be built in directions
that nobody's ever heard of.  So when I read the
claims of "eight frames high" in the CS Monitor
article, I rolled my eyes- not just because of the
cheapness of talk, but also because it is exactly what
you'd expect to happen next.  Besides, bicycles have a
looooong way to go if they want to beat the world's
record for tallest unicycle.

Unfortunately, that article is still in the editing
phase, having been started in March of last year.

Right, right, tell me about it.  Although sometimes it
can work to one's advantage, such as the way stories
of Cap'n Stay-n-School's heroism grow in heroic-ness
or the time that a friend of a friend described my
trip-high as being comprised of no fewer than nine
frames.

On that note, the rumor I heard was that a traveling
group from the Hard Times BC inspired CHUNK.  If this
is true, it would trace the current incarnation of
mutant bikery to a single moment twelve years ago,
when Per was handed an old Popular Mechanics article
about how to make a tallbike.  Since then, most
everybody I've talked to cites CHUNK as their
inspiration.  Of course, this wouldn't be the
beginning of what we do overall, as it has a rich
history going back almost two centuries as you well
know.  Just its reincarnation after the death of the
golden age of choppers in the sixties and seventies. 
We actually have some old photographs and engravings
from the turn of the century of Chicago tallbikery,
including tallbike racing!  Chicago was so important
in the early history of the bicycle (apparently at one
time 100 of the nation's 300 bicycle manufacturers
were located along Lake street), it's a shame the town
is so un-bike-cited today.  Of course, we're trying to
change that.

Your ally,

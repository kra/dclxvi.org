The Atomic Zombie Krew has begun work on "BladeRunner", a human powered =
chopper like no other. This machine has a 13 inch wide drag slick on the =
rear rim - a rim made by splitting two 15 inch car rims in half and =
rewelding them so there is no "ugly" side. This ultra fat rear tire is =
so ridiculous that it defies the very rebellion that makes the chopper =
what it is.

The frame will have geometry so radical that even Jesse James would give =
it a double take, and as eye candy the entire bike will have blades =
worked into the design - hence the name BladeRunner. The forks will be =
over 5 feet long.

To launch this machine in a blaze of glory, we have contacted Guinness =
again, and will shoot for the record of "World's Longest Chopper". A =
second set of forks measuring in at 40 feet (read that again - yes I =
said 40 feet!) will be connected to the bike for the record attempt. The =
current record is not even close to this - in fact it is about half of =
that, and that includes the long frame behind the head tube. In true =
Zombie spirit, I am only counting the length of the forks for my record =
- they way it should be.

Photos coming as work progresses. So far we have the rear rim and axel =
made as well as a few bits of the frame.

A.Z.K.

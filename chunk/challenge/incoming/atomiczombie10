No problem!

It would definitely be cool to see more tall bikes - for some reason I have
always enjoyed freeflying through the streets on these two wheeled death
machines. I actually try to ride the tallbike a few times each month as long
as weather permits - no snow, or high winds. I usually start by clinging for
life to a steel telephone pole in front of the house, and then get used to
the look of the ground at 15 feet in the air (sometimes this takes a few
minutes). Once vertigo has been overcome, I lunge on the pedals as hard as I
can, since getting this beast started is a Herculean task. During a ride, I
time the stop lights so I can just keep riding - this is easy to do even 5
blocks away since you can see forever on the SkyCycle. I can ride up and
down curbs by lifting the front wheel (this is a bit scary), and in an
emergency, can usually find another pole, tree, or streetlight to grab hold
of.

I really try to avoid situations that may require bailing from the captains
seat, as this will certainly end up in some type of injury - a 15 foot jump
is like jumping from the very peak of your house roof. it's fun to ride past
transport trucks and peer down at the dumbfounded driver looking up at you,
or scooting past a third story window as dismayed families rush to the
window in amazement after seeing your "floating head" roll on by.

A tall bike like the SkyCycle is a machine inviting ONLY to the true hard
core adrenaline junky. Most people who claim that they can ride the beast
climb back down after the 12 foot mark trembling in fear. So far, I am the
only pilot of the current 15 foot tall SkyCycle.

If you like, I can send you some video of a ride.

Cheers,
Brad

Can't wait to see all the wild and crazy entries to your "Ginormity"

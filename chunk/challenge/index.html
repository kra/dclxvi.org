<h1 align=center>The Wheeled Ginormity Challenge.</h1>

<p>
Occasionally in our travels we encounter vehicles which are billed as
the World's Tallest Tallbike or the World's Longest Chopper or
whatever.  They've always been impressive bikes, and possibly even
worthy of a world record, but really.  World exposure is needed before
claims of world domination can be asserted.
</p>

<p>
We ourselves are not as interested in finding the single tallest or
longest or most puzzling bicycle that is to be found on the planet.
There are already organizations, such as the Guinness Book of World
Records, that are looked toward to provide these factoids.  We don't
necessarily agree or disagree with their decisions, either - we only
appreciate bikes that hit the streets and interact with
people, while Guinness is satisfied with a museum exhibit that has
wobbled fearfully around a parking lot once.  The tallest
<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&u=/040118/480/dtc10501180019">
unicycles</a>
are taller than the tallest tallbikes, anyway.
</p>

<p>
Instead, we wish to honor those who strive to create
bikes that are among the longest, tallest, and mightiest.  None of us
on this earth today can compare our rides to the tallbikes of the
Nephilim, yet even they were not able to keep their heads above the
waters!
</p>

<p>
We therefore provide this space to allow the pedal-powered
monstrosity engineers of the planet to formally stake their claims to 
enter the ranks of the Tallest Tallbikes and Longest
Choppers.
Present your images and any supporting documentation to us via the
address below, and we will present them here.
</p>

<h2 align=center>Prizes.</h2>

<p>
Nothing worth squabbling about.  Winners will receive glory and a
night on the town with
C.H.U.N.K. 666 during which a trophy or a medal or something will be
presented, if we happen to be in the same town while the record
is still held and the bike is still ridable.  This is an ongoing
competition.
</p>

<h2 align=center>Rules.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The height of a tallbike will be measured from the saddle to the
      ground.  The length of a chopper will be measured from the front
      wheel to the back wheel.
  <li>For Longest Chopper entries, the distance between the head tube
      and the front wheel must be at least as long as the
      distance between the head tube and the rear wheel.  If there is
      more
      than one head tube, the one closest to the front wheel will be
      used for this measurement.
  <li>Entries must be solely human powered.
  <li>Entries must be rideable.  The bike must be ridden on a loop
      course
      such as a city block or equivalent, where the starting point is
      the same as the ending point, during which time only the wheels
      may touch the ground or other objects - no dabbing, poling, or
      similar.  The rider must start from a complete stop on level
      ground, with no
      human assistance such as holding up or pushing, although
      leaning against a building or other object and pushing off
      <em>at the starting line</em> is permissible.
  <li>Only two wheels may touch the ground or any other object while
      the course is being navigated - no trikes, outriggers, wheelie
      bars, etc.  The vehicle may have more than two wheels, but any
      wheels exceeding two must not touch the ground during this
      time.  Single-track vehicles only, no steamrollers or other
      crafty cheats.
  <li>Entries must be ridden at least occasionally outside of the
      competition.  It doesn't matter where or how - parades, milk
      runs, lamplighting duties, whatever - but the bike must be taken
      out and ridden once in a while.
  <li>These rules may be amended and modified at any time, as there's
      always something that wasn't thought of for this kind of thing.
      We will show no favoritism, and in return ask contestants to be
      sporting.
</ul>


<h2 align=center>To Enter.</h2>

<p>
Send images, measurements, and corroborating evidence to
<a href="mailto:megulon5@dclxvi.org">&lt;megulon5@dclxvi.org&gt;</a>
 or to C.H.U.N.K. 666, POB 5791, Portland, OR 97228.  You
must give us permission to reprint these here and in print
publications, and you must give us a means of contacting you, although
you may ask to remain anonymous.  Entries must include an image of the
vehicle being ridden, a description of the vehicle and how it came to
be built, a description of the course listed below, and an account,
whether exciting or boring, of riding the vehicle in an activity
unrelated to this contest.

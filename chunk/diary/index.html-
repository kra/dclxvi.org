Burnout, Wheelie, and two unidentified companions
on an earlier expedition for the Society.
</font>
</p>

<p>
During the demolition of the ruins of an old Theosophist tea house in
Baltimore, a collection of documents was found that shed new light on
the strange history of Dr. Phineas Burnout and Wilhelm ``Papa''
Wheelie, who along with the mysterious Roy D. were instrumental in the
founding of C.H.U.N.K. 666.  Apparently, before the Theosophists
acquired the building, it was the headquarters for the Wheeled
Exploration Society, within which Burnout and Wheelie were renowned
for their fearless adventuring spirit and amazing accounts of strange
lands and cultures.  Until this find, little was known about their
1889 expedition to the Mongolian steppe, even though as far as the
historical record shows, neither gentleman ventured beyond the shores
of America afterward.  The Society archives simply cease to mention
either of the pair.
</p>

<p>
The writings of Burnout himself show a desire for this account to
remain secret.  In his cover letter to the Secretary and Archivist of
the Society, he mentions that it was only due to his obligation to the
sponsors of the voyage that he sent word back to the States at all.
He writes that
&quot;an extremely 
odd tragedy has occurred which I am hesitant to commit to
paper, lest my sanity be brought into question.&quot;
Although he admits
that
&quot;traveling from eastern Europe to Mongolia by bicycle did of course
come with its share of hardships, but we braved nothing that was
beyond the abilities of 
two seasoned adventurers such as ourselves... even the vast expanses of
the steppe were slowly being conquered by the steady progress of our
wheels,&quot;
he emphatically
recommends that no further wheelmen explore north of the Gobi.

We were lounging by the fire after dinner, in the tent of the local
tribal chieftain.  After several cups of fermented yak's milk - very
delicious once the taste is acquired, and quite intoxicating - the
nomadic leader became more and more effusive in his praises of our
skill in riding our bicycles over the roadless expanses.  We were by
then used to curiosity about our machines, for the nomads near
the Gobi do not make use of the wheel, preferring instead to carry
their belongings on sledges and saddlebags.  This man,
however, did not view our bicycles as amazing and hithertofore unknown
machines.  He had a name for them in the local dialect, and claimed to
know of a tribe to the North which constructed and used their own
versions!  The praise directed towards us was not for our unique
inventions, but for our spiritual hardiness in conquering some manner of
evil supernatural creatures that our machines were said to embody.
The Northern clan was said to be very rich and successful, and
occupied a large territory that was shunned by the other tribes
because of the dangers of their pact with these sinister beings.  The
grand welcome that we were enjoying was partly due to fear for the
powers that we were seen to possess as wheelmen.

We, of course, doubted these stories, but felt it was our duty to
investigate.  After a long evening of conversation with, we
turned in to resume our wanderings the next day.

I and my companion
each passed a seemingly endless night
of bizarre nightmares. I remember seeing myself helplessly clutching
a high perch while a horde of shadowy riders upon bicycles made of
human bones darkened the entire land from horizon to horizon.  I could
not discern their purpose, but in the strange manner of dreams I saw
them sweep all of Mongolia bare, then Asia and Europe, and then
turn their attentions to the shores of America before I jerked
awake with a start.

It is now dawn, and time for us to take to the wheel, despite our
headaches.

Our search has been arduous, simply because of the
large deserted buffer between the tribes.  After a week of travel, we
are lost and nearly out of supplies.  We would surely have perished
during this evening's storm, if we had not found shelter in these
decrepit ruins.

This morning was indeed bleak.  If the truth is to be told, my
only desire was to huddle where we lay and await death not as an
adventurer, but as a helpless, lost child.  Wilhelm was in a similar
state.  It took a great deal of willpower to simply stand up and scan
the area, but when I did, my shocked exclamation roused my companion as
well.  There, on the crumbling remains of a wall, was an eerie,
blasphemous mural, clearly composed by primitive shamans who did not
see the world in the way that we did.  I saw semihumanoid gods or
demons whose malformed, contorted bodies were not fully distinct from
the fantastic floating contraptions from which they dangled.  I saw
humans and monsters conversing, battling, and - I must be frank -
copulating without regard to the constraints of gravity or matter.
And throughout this maelstrom of unworldly visions, I saw devices
which, despite their twisted and perverted shapes, were unmistakably
bicycles of some sort.  The angular knobbiness of each rider was
echoed in the structure of his ride, and again, it was at times
impossible to tell where flesh ended and machine began.  While
there were 
perfectly proportioned human beings, there were also warped monstrosities
with vestigial leathery wings, tentacles instead of arms, and knees
which towered higher than their heads even when the legs to which they
were
attached were at the bottom of
the pedal stroke.  I saw -- I can and will not repeat everything that I
saw, but I will relate that what we saw should have stricken fear into
our hearts and caused us to turn back, rather than galvanize us as it
did.

Yesterday, with the knowledge that we were near our quarry, we found
new reserves
of strength, which unfortunately did not last long after we had packed
our things and pressed on.  Once again, our spirits were flagging, and
once again, we received another reprieve in the form of a sighting.
Far off in the distance, an indistinct form on an even more indistinct
wheeled steed could be seen.  We doggedly followed this apparition
for hours, slowly narrowing the distance between us.  The man in
question was apparently a lone yak herder, driving his animals across
the steppe.  When
we were finally within hailing distance, the two of us commenced to
attract the rider's attention by shouting and gesticulating.  This
agitated the herd, and apparently the rider as well, for he let loose
a baneful blast of his horn, raised his bow and, to our surprise,
fired an arrow into
the flank of a nearby bull.  The arrow was tethered
to his machine, and both rider and bicycle were quickly beyond the horizon
just behind the stampeding herd.
This defeat was humiliating, and once again, we sank to the ground in
desperation.  The odds seem to be piling up against us.  I don't know
where we will find the stamina to continue.

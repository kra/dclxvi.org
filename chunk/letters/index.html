We have been doing this for a couple years. Last summer we garbage picked 30
or 40 bikes in about three months. We broke many hack saw blades which led us
to pick up a Sawzall to do some heavy work with. As far as tall bikes are
concerned-did I mention the Tandem-monoium. We managed to pick up a Huffy
Tandem. Our friend Jeff pioneered, for us at least, the definitive tall bike.
With extra long wheel base already established we went to work extending the
forks using a combination of the Orb and Gazelle fork methodology. (Not a good
idea) We should have used BMX-Extendo. We ended up using 4-26" donor forks
reversing every other pair, sacrificing safety for height. When all was said
and done with hose clamps and metal zip ties in place we carried it out of the
garage on its side (due to extreme height). It became apparent we could not
ride it like normal. There was just no way to get on the thing and balance long
enough to pedal. Solution: Loosen front pair of Ape Hanger handle bars to make
them reachable from the rear seat. Get on rear seat and go-at speed climb over
rear set of bars to the lofty front seat or at this point the top seat. Head
height: approx. 12 feet. Stopping: Each pilot was on their own. Stopping near
other tall objects proved to be the most successful. The falling/jump/ejection
method worked but took its toll on the unstable vehicle.

i once built a chopper based on a teeny-weeny kid's bike (picture a bmx bike for a two year old).  
I put some extended forks on an elbow bent to about 80 degrees, and a foot long seat post.  The 
result was great, but it put the banana seat right above the rear axle.  ok, it put it a little 
behind, so i had serious wheelie problems unless i hunched way over.  Determined to make it 
work, i nutted some extendos onto the front axle and had my roomate sort of squat over the 
front wheel and hold on to the handlebars facing me.  It worked GREAT.  visibility was a little 
impaired however, and after an incredibly successful test ride which ended a little badly, i was 
on my own.  When i moved the seat forward, the forks broke.  that was
three years ago.

I've been cannibalizing parts from abandoned bikes here, too. Ann Arbor
makes it real easy -- the grounds crew come around and tag abandoned bikes
with these impound stickers, and if people don't claim them in 6 months -
a year, they slap yellow stickers on them for city pickup. You can just 
go cruising looking for yellow tagged bikes, and there are some real 
beauties, some old Schwinn tigers and stuff. What I need is a heli-arc 
welder so I can *really* hurt myself on a Frankenstein road monster. Did 
Greg show you the picture of our stunt bike? We setup a devilish little 
low rider and jumped it thru an 8 foot ring of fire, it was something to 
see...

As you have probably heard through the grapevine Al Kuniferous has been
laid off; hence he will be forced to dedicate all of his (spare) time to 
the production of CHOPPERS.  Now that is not enough to guarantee 40 
CHOPPERS; however, recently our good friend Alberto took me to heaven on 
earth.  We have found our great CHUNKMASTER and if we offer him the 
proper offerings (cash money) he will provide the sweetest morsels to 
produce the cherriest choppers possible from his mountainous CHUNK stash 
of say ~1500.  Not only is our CHUNKMASTER the keeper of the mother lode 
he has also survived the third world war and as a result has a huge nose 
tumor which makes it difficult to look him in the eye when bargaining-- 
one of his special powers to keep all in a subservient position.

<p>
Hello and good day.
</p>

<p>
On obtaining the declassified 666 documents (WWW) I reprinted and delivered them to
my cohort, TD.  He then related to me the extent of his own experience
in designing
and assembling choppers out of found/recycled materials, which I tell
 you is
formidable.  Further, he was able to produce a fully functional chopper
utilizing a
methodology of his own design, using materials at hand, within a time
 span of less
than four hours.  Impressive, no?
</p>

<p>
TD and I were very impressed with your literature, Chunk.  It came much
as a wake up
call to rouse our tired skulls.  We realized instantly that we must
join the
resistance from our lowly outpost here on the third coast.  As of the
 drafting of
this letter, we have one working chopper (see below), one in production
(which I
expect to be done by this afternoon), and many several lined up, as we
have very many
damaged men and bicycles to be put to the task, which we believe is a
 noble one. 
These developments are like a Texas thunderhead that pops up unexpectedly
and blows
your trailer away with no warning.  That is, we will have at least two
working
choppers within thirty-six hours of first reading your material. 
</p>

<p>
We will now relate the still-secret technology which produced
the first
true Ft. Worth (non-low rider) chopper fork, employed by the
first known
Ft.Worth area chopper, the SLING-THING.  It has performed beautifully,
and has a
simplicity which we think you will appreciate.
</p>

<p>
Essentially it works like this:  Chop the forks as usual, leaving the
 remaining fork
legs about five inches long (cut them off where they start to curve
forward, the
longer the stronger).  The secret technology is this:  JcPenny/Sears/???
lawn
furniture, specifically in this case a stand alone hammock.  You simply
cut two
lengths of the aluminum tubing that this stuff is made out of.  You
know the kind
with the indented holes in it.  The hammock frame afforded two lengths
of almost four
feet each.  And you use them for your extensions.  TD hammered them in
 to position,
drilled and bolted them in to place (no welding).  This aluminum tubing
has flat ends
with a hole already in them from when it was a pre-fab hammock (or
whatever).  This
is a ready made dropout.  The indented holes in this type of tubing may have
potential for accessorizing purposes.  It seems very stable and seems
 to have
substantial CHUNKosity, as it utilizes easily obtainable materials in
 its
construction, accurately simulates the effects of alcohol and/or
barbiturate usage,
and receives assorted looks of fear and repulsion from the pinkish
Mediocretans which
surround us.  Lawn furniture is very available and easily tailored to
 this
application.  The Sling-Thing sluices forth with its proud motto emblazoned
on the top
tube:
<em>Fuck Yer Car</em>.
</p>

<p>
We hope that this info proves useful.
</p>

<p>
TD has requested information on the CHUNK singles scene.  Please forward.
</p>

<p>
<em>
At first, one becomes bestial, grunting and sniffing bicycle seats and
so on.  Once chopper crotch sets in, one's genitals will be a
pus-oozing mass of putrefaction.  At this point one must keep on
chopping until one devolves enough to reproduce asexually.
</em>
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your attention.  Long live the chopper.

what is up with tall bikes? my boys say they are the only tall bike 
club anywhere and that minneapolis is the tall bike capital of the 
universe.
</p>

<em>
<p>
Don't know about the capital of the universe stuff, altho noted bike
scientists Frank Rowland Whitt & David Gordon Wilson claim that the
taller the bike, the better for icy roads.  So maybe.  Actually, not a
chance.  Low-gravity planets, or planets covered with shallow water,
are surely more likely as tall-bike capitals of the universe.
</p>

<p>
But as to the only tall bike club anywhere, nonsense.  Tall bikes have
been around since the 1890s.

removed and crankarms installed plus street moto gearing so once he gets
the 200 pound thing rolling he hits speeds of 40mph. gang is also rumored

Me and my friend are trying to build up a fleet but
no one here is cool enough to join us, we have 4 rides so far so just
the 2 of us have to switch around for something to do.
Oh yeah I wanted to say one more
thing, it's about the letter that one guy wrote saying that choppers are
a waist of time and lowriders are so awesome.  That guy sucks, Im sick
of all these rich preppy's that think they can buy whatever just to be
cool, the bikes we ride aren't to be cool, or to brag about how much we
paid for, they are to screw our backs up, kill ours buts and have some
fun doin it, if someone looks ur way while ur doing it because ur bike
look messed up or makeshift compared to all the other thousand dollar
bikes out there then all the better.

spent the winter in madison with my roommate building some bikes.  the first
was a crappy gazelle fork (just hammered on) girls huffy ten speed with a
scooter front wheel and head tube/neck.(bike is called the huffy nightmare as
it was originally a huffy sweet dreams)  number two is a bmx rendition of a
highwheeler: that is to say a twenty seven inch front fork and wheel,
apehanger handlebars, bmx frame with a bent bmx seat post turned so the bend
put the seat forward instead of back, and a sixteen inch barbie wheel that
was gutted, a three speed internal hub installed, and then respoked.(bike is
called the praymantis due to its insect like appearance)
</p>

<p>
this brings me to my problem with number 3 (the peddle-file named so because
of the filing done on the forks with a hand file and because the chain ring
is oversized and is rubbing on the rear triangle- in effect filing the metal
with each peddle).  anyway we tried just cramming the extended forks together
ala gazelle style without welds or anything.  the materials used was a
regular bmx fork and two lengths of eighteen inch galvanized steel pipes with
grooved screw on, slightly tapered, ends.  the ends of these pipes were filed
to fit into the cut bmx forks snuggly.  about an inch and a half fit inside,
although the amount of pipe that was touching the inside of the fork was
less; filed down a little too much. hammering down one side during the final
assembly would invariably loosen the other side of the extended fork due to
vibrations. to get more pipe inside the fork to combat the loosening effect
of hammering in addition to greater structural stability we put the
galvanized pipes in the freezer overnight and, when the time was right,
heated the forks to 500 degrees in the oven.  it was a lame attempt at
utilizing the laws of thermal expansion that ultimately failed, as on the
test ride i hit a pothole and found myself without any front forks. so i
guess i really need to use a weld.  my friend is an art student with access to
an arc welder.  this is where my question arises. IS IT "SAFE" TO USE AN
ARCWELDER ON THE FORKS AND HOW MUCH PIPE SHOULD BE SLEEVED INSIDE THE FORK TO
INSURE SOME STABILITY?
</p>

<p>
<em>
We could tell you that a lap weld is pretty strong, so if you have a
feel for arc-welding thin mild steel you'll do fine, but that would be
a disservice.  Learn how to weld and practice, and test your joins,
and you'll know what to trust.

Hey man,

<p>
I'm a 42 year old 1970s ex motocrosser.  My 11 year old kid said the other day
he wanted a chopper.  I remembered my old Schwin Stingray that I chopped in
the late 60s.  So I took his BMX and chopped it 36 inches.  Man the local kids
are goin nuts over the bike.  Of course theres always the few dick weeds who
say "Thats really stupid man".  Well screw em.  Choppers LIVE!!!!!!
</p>

<p>

(We expressed worry about his son; doesn't every kid need a BMX
bike to do bunny hops on?)

</p>

<p>
Bunny hop, bunny schmop.  Besides it was his old BMX.  He has another for
hoppin.  Besides what was I supposed to do? There wasn't a sting ray in
sight.  So I made do.  I am a bit of a mechanical artist and if I do say so,
the bike came out lookin pretty damn sharp.  Ha, all the other dads are pissed
cause now their kids want them to chop their bikes.  Those bozos could'nt chop
carrots let alone a bike.  
Bottom line:  My kid has the coolest bike in town, cause his dad never forgot
his miss spent youth!

as springer forks whitewalls and fresh paint.results cruisers that cause
major "hawking".I like your concept and imagination and even your mission
statement,but would however point out that 777 would be a better number to
follow your name.because the fellow with that number along with his coherts
will find eternal damnation.I am sure that it is with many in this "jilted"

<p>
The Society is primarily concerned with the: "resurrection of the
earth's great cities as centers of memory". The persons they possess
often refer to "infrastructure enhancements and modifications" which
they believe will benefit the planet at large. Commonly cited are
various techniques of physically changing the urban
environment to facilitate its interaction with human beings "instead
of the dominant machines".
</p>

 
<p>
Agency historical consultants have recognized some relation in the
character of the organization to the customs and rhetoric of the late
19th century civic improvement societies of North America but they
believe that time travelers and other supernatural and alien elements
may be involved as well.

Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>
It was with some considerable disgust that I stumbled upon your so
called web page. As a keen aficionado of the velocipede I was appalled
to the see the carnage inflicted upon a few bicycles. The very idea of
cannibalizing the sacred triangle configuration  is anathema to me and
all sensitive cyclists. Our stress perfect triangle has been with us
since the last century when, of course, an Englishman first concocted
this sublimely
beautiful shape. Reading of lengthened forks and banana seats tickled an
area of sensitivity in me that I haven't felt since I was an
experimental adolescent. Try not to take my purist attitude as a
snobbish "dis" of your "art", why even I, as a troubled young man, had a
friend who owned a raleigh chopper. These where indeed dark days for me,
however now I own a largely sensible Trek mountain bike, with fat rubber
tyres. I love my Trek, but to torment her sensitive carbon tubing with
the rigors of the so called "wheelie", is something that I could never
consider.
</p>

<p>
I must confess to having a particular fondness for the 1890's safeties.
These are of course the quintessential triangle frames. The wheels of
these old bikes where also true and pure in a way seldom found today,
none of your different sizes and white or dirty tyres. I wonder how the
Wright Brothers would have regarded the bicycle designs that you so
openly flaunt, I'm certain they would be flying in their
graves if they knew.
</p>

<p>
Anyway enough chit chat, good luck, seek help.

<p>
Hi, my name is Jack Bent.  I am a senior at Bishop Kelley High School in Tulsa
Oklahoma.  That much is incidental.  My whole reason for being a high school
student is so that I can provide guidance to the Earth Club through my Pro-
Eco-Terrorism Campaign.  Prior to my realization that I could enjoy the
feeling of burning plants in my lungs while earning required service hours by
joining the politically correct, yet politically stagnant Earth Club, their
activities consisted mostly of feeding the criminalized species at
the animal impound and display chamber. Along I came and introduced them to
the wonderful world of aggressive conservation.  Every Wednesday, 30 marginally
intoxicated high school students ride their bicycles to school and back.
Upon arriving at school, those more advanced in the art of bicycle stuntery
will perform "paint checks" on the automobiles of those insensitive to the
needs of bikes.  This procedure consists of "grinding" metal pegs attached to
the axle across the front or rear bumper of the spoiled brats' Saturn.
This is necessary to see if a new paint
job is needed.  If this procedure is executed correctly, then analysis will
reveal that new paint is indeed needed.
</p>

<p>
Also, my school fails to provide adequate retention devices, so we are forced
to leave our vehicles in the marked spaces in the parking lot, forcing less
self-reliant sheep to park off of school property risking their stereos. The
administration has voiced their displeasure in this practice, so we retaliated
by bringing our bikes into the building and into every class, Mary had a
little lamb style.
</p>

<p>
Happily, I report that this movement has spread to several other high schools
through my variable social propaganda project.  Motorists have stared to plan
for our Wednesday morning rides by leaving early, or sleeping late.  Either
way, this causes them to vary the redundancies of their mundane lives,
frustrating them and making them unproductive in their cubicles.  
</p>

For a while, some of us decided to only patronize those bars classy
enough to give us indoor bike parking, but we turned out to be too
weak to keep it up.

first....I'd grudgingly comply and head back to the garage, hammer off
the extensions and slyly sneak them into my socks under my old bell
bottom jeans, stick a large &quot;crescent&quot; adjustable wrench (usable as a
hammer, too) into my back pocket and ride innocently out of the
driveway....only to stop just out of sight and hammer them back on, bolt
up the wheel and go!

[After hearing our claim to be the last Critical Mass ride of
1999 (see the Y2K ride), Car Busters promised a big kiss from the
editorial collective for whoever really was the last]</em>
</p>

<p>
We have
received a report that one branch of San Francisco Critical Mass was
still on the road at midnight. Here’s what they say:
</p>
<p>
&quot;By midnight we had reached the point in the bike path where the
freeway overpass crosses, and decided to go sit at the side of the
estuary for a quick nip of scotch and a small celebration. Under the
overpass, there was apparently a police staging area. As midnight
rolled by, they lined up for a group photo, one of them looking kinda
goofy, like a chorus girl. I yelled over 'Yoo hoo! Looking good,
honey!' Someone came on over the cop loudspeaker and said 'Happy New
Year!' A strange little truce with the man at the passing of the old
year. Must be gettin' soft in the head.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Course, technically speaking, they were sat at midnight, so the Car
Buster's team have decided the winners are the CHUNK 666ers.
If you guys want to come and claim your hearty round of
kisses, the prize is yours!

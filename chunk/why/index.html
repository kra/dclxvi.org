<h1>Why?</h1>

<blockquote>
You know what I dig, man?  I dig them beautiful customized jobs.  You
know why?  'Cause I look at a scooter, man, that's completely chopped,
man, and every part on it he either made himself or bought special for
it.  Now you look at that dude, and that dude's an outlaw.  Whatever
he rides, man, part of that scooter is him, 'cause it's got his ideas
and it's just him.  Every scooter, see?  Say you take a guy that buys
a brand new Harley-Davidson, fully equipped.  There'll always be a
motherfucker comes along and says, well, I got one exactly like
yours.  'Cause he can get it exactly like his.  But all choppers are
different.  Every one of 'em, different.  No matter how much alike you
build, you know what I mean?  They're all different.  'Cause
everbody's melon's different.  Everybody thinks different.  So when I
look at a chopper, man, I respect the dude becase he made his.  The
dude over there, this dresser rider, man, he bought his.  Never done a
lick of work on it but maybe tighten bolts.  That's the difference.

We do this to have fun, hasten the upcoming tribulation, and save the
children.  Some of us are fighting for the right to party,
others are partying for the right to fight, and it doesn't matter
which is which.  We clear a space for ourselves on the street, and we
like to think that we're an inspiration to some of those who want to
see a cycling revival (and an enemy to those who don't want the
revival to be fun).  In the end, it doesn't matter.  We only do what
we do because we can't help it.

It's ironic that the safest place to be on a bike in the city is in a
pack of fucked up mutant tetanus machines.  Isn't that backwards?  Can
there be any doubt that the slide
into barbarism has already begun?  Are you going to watch it on
television and keep a straight face the whole time?

People think that the post-apocalyptic world will be all rough and
tough, hard living and scrabbling for survival, but that's not true at
all.  It'll be a glorious paradise!  People will look back at today and
talk about how crazy we were.  They'll ask why we had to scamper
across a street and take our
lives in our hands just to pick up a six-pack.  They'll wonder why we lived in cities made for
cars, on streets made for cars with little access corridors on the
side for peds, in
houses with big central front doors for cars and little side doors for
people.  They'll laugh at pictures of people eating in outdoor
restaurants with hideous views and smells of streets and parking
lots.  They'll ponder the stupidity of neighborhoods full of parked
cars that start blaring their sirens in the middle of the night for no
reason.
They'll wonder why manslaughter wasn't a crime when the killer was
driving a car.  They'll say, &quot;no wonder civilization collapsed, everyone
shut themselves up in big coffins when they wanted to go anywhere,
nobody talked to each other - they could only say one thing, and that
was HONK! HONK! FINGER!&quot;

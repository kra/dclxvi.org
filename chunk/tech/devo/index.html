<p>
Many feel that devolution is a tragic but unavoidable consequence of
riding a Chunkcycle.  Not so!  Devolution is the very reason for
riding these things!

After the imminent Apocalypse, nothing will be the same.  As has been
noted, the laws of physics will be radically different than they are
at the moment.  Today, our bicycles seem to be good for nothing other
than fucking shit up and getting dates.  Tomorrow, they will be a joy
to ride!  Pedaling uphill will feel like pedaling downhill, and
pedaling downhill will feel like soaking in a vat of warm olive oil.
Today, our bicycles are dangerous to ride and prone to falling apart.
Tomorrow, they will be unsinkable, while other bicycles will
spontaneously <strong>explode</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The situation for human beings will be similar.  The world is rife
with smug <em>homo sapiens</em> who feel that they are the pinnacle of
evolution.  We have news for these people.  After the coming
Apocalypse, evolution will be turned on its ass!  Those who have
expended so much time and energy on evolving will
become as helpless babies!  It is those who have
<strong>devolved</strong> who will again be at the top of the food
chain.

This, gentle reader, is the true reason for Chunking.  Many wonder why
we do the things that we do.  They think that after the coming Apocalypse,
they will be able to just jump on a chunkcycle and take a crash course
in piloting it.  They will find this impossible.  Their backs will lack
the required hunch.  Their hairless tongues will be unsuited for
wiping fallout particles from the wheels.  When their mounts seize up
and refuse to move, they will wish that they could exude a lubricating
mucus like we can!
</p>

<p>
This is why we live with the horrid effects of riding our
steeds.  In fact, these effects are themselves nothing other than the
early stages of devolution.  Ever notice how the Chunklings who
complain the most about hunchback will happily knuckle-walk down the
street?  Neither is it a coincidence that those who are hit the worst by
"chopper crotch" lose all interest in the shuffling and
grunting associated with human mating activities.  They have
discovered asexual reproduction!

<p>
One doesn't have to be interested in post-Apocalyptic living to
devolve.  Devolution is fun.  Swinging from the trees and
chest-slapping is fun.  Orang-utangs can unscrew machine-tightened
bolts with their bare fingers!  Slithering through the muck is a blast.
Grunting and hooting feels
great.  Give it a try!

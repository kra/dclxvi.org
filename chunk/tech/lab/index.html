<h1 align=center>The Secret Laboratory.</h1>
<p>
  The Secret Laboratory is, of course, where we perform all of our
  research and development.  We also recreate there; the concentrated
  fumes are potent, and there are plenty of bicycle saddles to sniff when
  one is lonely.  It is where we keep the foundation of any
  scrounge-based biker club: the stash pile.  We'd love to hide this
  underground, but who has a tunnel network big enough?  Not us, so if
  you come across our pile in the yard, keep your hands to yourself, for
  your own safety.

		Besides a few tiny children happily working terms of
		indentured servitude before they can begin their predevolution
		therapy sessions, there are some permanent residents of the
		lab.  After too many hours with their faces close to the
		torch, Vog and Skeeter can no longer breathe the rarefied air
		of the upper levels.  Skeeter does fine with a small sample of
		burning chrome and cadmium residue in his mask, so he can
		still wheel around in the yard and collect parts.

<p>
The lab has moved several times as influences
  from within and without the hosting house make it less or more chopper
  friendly.  Occupants will arrive and leave, landlords will suddenly
  pay a visit, and neighborhood
  busybodies sometimes send the cops around to make us clean up.  When
  complete domination of the immediate area starts to take too much
  effort, we pick through the piles for the most precious parts,
  load up the carts, and leave the dregs behind.  We've had to move a
  few times, and have even left a house only to return to it a few
  years later when it again became pliable.  Lately we've branched
  out, forming auxiliary chunkstations around town.

In the future, the waters will rise again.  Much of the terrestrial
world will be submerged, and will become one giant stash pile, ripe
for the harvesting by our aquachoppers.  Currently, however, only the
bottom two or three layers spend much time underwater.

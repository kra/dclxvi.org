Tallbike construction - how hard can it be?  Put one bike on top of
another and weld them together.  Make sure that the headtubes are
aligned.  Putting the rider forward of the rear hub is even more
important than on a chopper, because that ass is on a long rotation
arm.  Make some kind
of jig (at right, some two by fours cinched with zipties) if you want
them to be straight, but so long as the chainrings are angled closely
enough to keep the chain on, a bent frame doesn't matter as much,
because there's a
lot of correction time when the rider is so far from the pavement.

When I met some riders from the Hard Times Bike Club, I noticed that
they had
welded little flanges to their left chainstays to aid in climbing up.
How silly, I thought, I shall continue to hoist
myself aboard directly with my left foot on the pedal.  Now I'm over
30, and I'm making those little flanges also, because my knees
don't do so well with all of that lifting up and jumping down.
Incidentally, the first diamond
frame "safety" bicycles had these little flanges as well, vestigial
parts from the highwheeler frames.
They were
needed to leap onto the saddle of a highwheeler, and the sporty lads
of the day
continued to mount their safeties by vaulting over the rear wheel in the
same way.

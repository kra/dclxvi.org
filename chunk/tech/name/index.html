<h1 align=center>Naming.</h1>

<p>
An important element in the creation of a chopper, even more important
than its baptism in blood, is its naming.
</p>

<h2 align=center>Why.</h2>

<p>
The act of
naming important artifacts is a tradition that predates recorded
history.  This act both invites animistic spirits to inhabit the
object in question, and helps to shape their personalities as desired.
Objects of great might or prowess make an impact in the
animistic sphere and will therefore assuredly attract the attention of
other entities.  Therefore, the absence of a name leaves such an
object vulnerable
to the hindering influence of malevolent spirits, and
even opens the possibility of unwanted possession.  This is especially
true for vehicles, which must carry the body without leaving the soul
behind.
</p>

<h2 align=center>How.</h2>

<p>
In general, the name of a bicycle
must include the prefix "B.", for Bicycle.  This is so that bicycles
do not get confused with human beings.
The name of a bicycle must also include the suffix "666".
This is because of the Promethean influence of the bicycle, best
exemplified by the
revolution in mobility and independence bicycles provided
in the late 1800s.  The suffix also commemorates the tantalizing
opportunities for
crimes and vandalism which present themselves while bicycling.
These prefices and suffices are, however, purely formal, and usually
omitted in casual conversation.
</p>

<p>
For the naming of a chopper, gruesome and
fear-instilling names are usually in order.  This is because the
proper construction of a chopper instills the beast with a powerful and
malevolent demon - a demon who has many friends.  Just as the ingestion of
alcohol causes one to become visible to hordes of "alcohol demons",
which inflict no end of trouble, so does the apparatus of the chopper
produce the same effect with regards to an evil host of "chopper
demons".
Each chopper has associated with it a personal demon to lead this
horrible ensemble, and it is after this demon that the chopper must be
named.  Failure to perform this act will surely enrage the creature,
who will inevitably bring about a quick and painful end to one's
chopping experience.
</p>

<h2 align=center>What.</h2>

<p>
With this in mind, a chopper should be given a name which will best
please the personality of the resident demon high commander.  This
personality will of course sync with the personality of the chopper in
question, and should thus reflect that chopper's characteristics.
In this vein we have the
Cherry-Popper (a.k.a. the Deboner), with its dismembering
protrusion
poised to perform the act alluded to, and Vlad the Impaler, who
points his mighty shaft at the fragile chest cavity of his hapless
pilot.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the name of the chopper is formed by more subtle
characteristics; the Orb, for example, is so named because that word
happened to be already inscribed upon the side of its frame at the
time of salvaging, and only in retrospect because of its eye-gouging
ability.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, naming is often inspired by the history
of the steed.  There was once, by way of illustration, a lovely
twelve-speed bicycle ridden by the author and known as B. 25, due to the
fact that the sole identifying insignia on its frame was
the number 25 stamped in the metal.  This bicycle, after ramming no
fewer than three cars, suffered a death all too violent for an
unchoppified bicycle.  After the parts of 25 lived anew upon
the frame of its predecessor, B. Ralph Waldo 5, 25's bent frame
was hung in the tombs bearing the inscription "Organ Donor".  A year
later some of its tubes were used to form the body of, you guessed it,
the Organ Donor, and it was when this inscription was again noticed
that that proud creation received its name.
</p>

<p>
Finally, a resonance with
steeds of earlier history provides a great excuse for a name.  The
more erudite reader will recognize the names of
Bucephalus, Rocinante, and King George VII as being a part of this
tradition.

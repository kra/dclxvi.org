<p>
The chopper fork is, of course, the germinal element  for most of the
fleet.  One reason for this is that
no bicycle design induces the feeling of intoxication better than the
chopper.  This is important because one will want to be as drunk as
possible in order
to survive the high incidence of crashes that accompany Chunk
activities.  A related reason is that chopper riding is an excellent
tool for self-actualization: one who can dominate a chopper finds that
everything else in life is that much easier to dominate.
</p>

<p>
There are a few general comments to be made about fork construction
and destruction.  The point
where the fork enters the head tube receives more stress than anywhere
else on a chopper.  Because of this, thick and sturdy parts should be
used for this component.  Modern, "high performance" forks are out.
Old, clunky forks made of thick steel are in.  Welding and brazing
performed in this area
also tends to weaken the machine, so be careful with that torch.
Redundancy is the key.
Either use a design that distributes stresses, or don't mess with that
area at all; extend after the bifurcation.
</p>

<p>
After the structural integrity (or lack of same) of a fork design is ensured, the
effect of the fork on the geometry of the bicycle must be taken into
account.  Draw a vertical line from the pilot's ass to the ground.
The rear hub must be behind this line.
If the hub is before the line, the front wheel will never touch the
ground, and the bicycle will be unridable.  If the hub is at or just
behind the line, the bicycle will wheelie at the slightest provocation
- which is fun, but should not be the case for every cycle
constructed; what is the use of riding if one can't run things
over?  Putting the line well before the hub puts more weight on the
front wheel, and makes the bicycle easier to steer, at the cost of
higher stress on the fork.  Experiments with weighting the fork to
allow the line to be moved back have proven unsuccessful, since the
weight tends to wrench the fork into a turn.
</p>

<p>
For a given frame, the length of the fork (along with the size of the
front wheel)
also affects the
angle of the stem.
This angle, the rake of the fork, and again the size of the wheel,
determine the trail of the bicycle.
To determine the trail, draw an imaginary line that
passes through, and parallel to, the
head tube and extends to the ground.
The trail is the distance between the point where this line hits the
ground and the contact patch of the front tire.  The effects of the
trail on steering are interesting; a document is being prepared by our
technicians.  In the meantime, you will have to experiment for
yourself.
</p>

<p>
We will now discuss specific models.

<p>
The simplest
method of chopper construction requires several extra forks,
as shown above in Stars and Stripes Forever.
</p>

<p>
First, saw the tips off of the fork of the host bike, so that the
dropouts for the front axle are removed.
Saw the blades off of each donor fork as well, just after the
bifurcation point, to create two separate blades each.
Saw the tips off of
each pair of donor blades except for one. This last pair will become the
end of the composite fork.
</p>

<p>
Slide the first pair of donor fork blades onto the host fork.
You may have to squish the wide ends of the donor blades in a vise for
a better fit.
Hammer these blades down well, making sure that the resulting
composite blades are of equal length.
Continue with each pair of donor
forks.  A rubber mallet works best for the final pair, to avoid
damaging the dropouts, but a metal hammer should be used for all of
the other pairs to ensure that they are tight.
By the way, bearing races which contain
little dents formed by the bearings are known as "brinneled".
</p>

<p>
Experiment with installing some
pairs of blades with the bend pointing down, to alter the rake and
trail.  If you can ride a bike with over four normal-sized forks, each
pointing forward, then you are mighty indeed.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have access to a brazing torch, you can simply ride your chopper
as-is, if you have a small front wheel.  The forks will eventually
sproing apart, but will in all probability remain assembled as
they do so, allowing you to stop without injury, hammer them back into
place, and continue riding.  Eventually, however, you will need to
replace the tips, as the dropouts will break from all that hammering.
If you can, brass braze the forks together.
Adding a bar across two of them will help the fork to resist torque,
and will allow you to use a larger front wheel, if you want.

</p>


<p>
The BMX-extendo design, as manifested in the Cherry-Popper
(a.k.a the De-Boner) shown above, is also very simple, but requires
the use of a torch.  An arc-welder will suffice if you have thick enough
forks and pipes, but as with all fork modifications, brazing is
recommended.
The name comes from the fact that a BMX type fork must be used, i.e. a fork
where the blades are parallel and straight, and rake is supplied by forward mounted dropouts
The method should be apparent from the following diagrams.
</p>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=182 WIDTH=254 SRC="image/fbaby72.jpg">
</p>

<p>
We now jump ahead to the current pinnacle of Chunk technology, the
design that gets us across town, the flux point of the wide-band
chunkulation field, the result of intense research, etc.,
etc..  Feast your eyes on the sleek fork of Baby, above.
Dangerous-looking, is it not?  Were that single narrow shaft to break,
the pilot would surely be impaled.  While structural failure in an
unmodified element of the fork is always a concern, this construction
method is as solid as the Rock of Ages.
</p>


<p align=center>
<IMG  WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=186 SRC="image/baby.fig1.gif" alt="[Fig. 3.]">
<br>
<cite> Fig 3. Bladeless host fork. </cite>
</p>

<p>
The first step involves sawing off the blades of the host fork, as
close as possible to where they join the shaft.  File the remaining shaft
until it is a cylinder again.  This should produce a single tube with a
wide base.  In the image above, the bottom part of the fork points to the
left, and the blades used to be attached to the wide part.
</p>

<p align=center>
<IMG  WIDTH=546 HEIGHT=186 SRC="image/baby.fig2.gif" alt="[Fig. 4.]">
<br>
<cite> Fig 4. Lengthened host fork (shortened to fit in diagram). </cite>
</p>

<p>
Next, obtain a pipe with the same diameter and
thickness as the wide (bottom) end of the host fork.  This pipe (along with
another while fork) will form the
visible shaft of the composite fork; it should therefore be as long as
you dare.
Butt-weld this pipe to
the wide end of the fork, and file it smooth.
</p>

<p align=center>
<IMG  WIDTH=546 HEIGHT=226 SRC="image/baby.fig3.gif" alt="[Fig. 5.]">
<br>
<cite> Fig 5. Lengthened host fork with reinforcement sleeve
(shortened to fit in diagram). </cite>
</p>

<p>
The next step requires a pipe which slides very snugly over the
previous butt-weld, about 8 to 14 centimeters long, and of roughly the same
wall thickness as the previous pipes.  Slip this pipe over the lengthened
tube, so that its center covers the butt-weld, and lap-weld it on.
</p>

<p>
Without this sleeve, the butt-weld would snap.  The sleeve distributes
the stress on that weld to both of its edges.
</p>

<p>
Finally, slide the steer tube of another donor fork into the bottom
end of the lengthened host fork, and weld it in.  Some sort of 
intermediate pipe may be necessary to shim it in securely.  This part
of the fork is sturdy, however - it could even be ridden without
welds, if the front wheel never left the ground - and one can get away
with that sort of thing there. 
</p>

<h2 align=center><a name="granddaddytech">The Granddaddy Fork.</a></h2>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=252 WIDTH=82 SRC="image/fgd72.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Named after the cycle which pioneered its use, the Granddaddy Fork is
simplicity itself.  Start with a long pipe with a fork affixed to the
bottom, as used in the Sleeved Tube Fork.  Find a solid tube that will
both snugly fit in this tube and through the <em>bottom</em> hole of 
the steer tube of a host fork (some
shimming will be required).  Insert it into the other end of the pipe
so that it
protrudes a ways, and weld or braze it there.
Take the host fork, saw off the blades just before their bends, and
smush the blades
together in a vise so that they are just as far apart as the pipe is
wide.  Then slide the assembly together so that the pipe is snug
against the host fork and the solid tube is within the host fork's
steer tube.  Braze at the three points of contact - top of tube and end
of two blades.
</p>

<p>
This fork is surprisingly strong - our materials have failed before
our welds have.
</p>

<h2 align=center><a name="orbtech">The Orb.</a></h2>

<p>
The Orb Mark IV has been broken several times.  We learn from our
mistakes at Chunk Labs, however - except for the mistake of getting on
our bikes in the first place.
</p>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=72 SRC="image/forb272.jpg">
</p>

<p>
The Orb Mark I was one of the first machines that we created.  The
lower part of the fork was a gazelle model, which was attached to a
pipe in the manner of the lower forks of Baby and Granddaddy.  This
pipe was then butt-welded to the
bottom of the steer-tube of a fork.  We were young and stupid then.
</p>

<p>
This design, of course, led to the shedding of blood when the
butt-weld failed.  For the Orb Mark III, we obtained a long, thick,
steel
steer tube from an old bombproof Raleigh three-speed, and
lap-welded it to the pipe, so that the bearing cone sat on the ledge
formed by the end of the pipe.
This weld held, but the steer tube itself snapped - all of the
stresses were delivered right to the end of the pipe.
</p>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=181 WIDTH=120 SRC="image/forb172.jpg">
<IMG  HEIGHT=181 WIDTH=252 SRC="image/forb072.jpg">
</p>

<p>
We then utilized the fact that the top of this particular gazelle fork
is such that the
shoulders of the fork crown protrude at a 90 degree angle.
Furthermore, each shoulder 
has a hole in it where the end of the fork blade extends through the
crown.  Forks like this are
usually found on cheaper children's bikes.
</p>

<p>
We lap-welded a smaller flange to extend from the top of the pipe, as
in Granddaddy.
This flange was inserted into the hole
at the base of the steer tube of an upper fork.  The tips of the
blades of the upper fork were sawn off, inserted into the holes on
the shoulders of the lower fork, and brazed in place.
</p>

<p>
The net result was a fork with a triply redundant connection
to the frame and flexibility at the bottom.
</p>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=252 WIDTH=252 SRC="image/forb372.jpg">
<IMG  HEIGHT=250 WIDTH=253 SRC="image/forb472.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Safety was not provided so much by solidity, but by
redundancy and the way that each of the pieces fit together without
the welds.  This feature saved the life of an unfortunate Chunker on
the Orb's final ride.  The fork was held together by gravity long
after the welds
had failed, and only after dismounting did separation occur.
R.I.P. the Orb Mark IV.

<h2 align=center><a name="railtech">The Rail.</a></h2>

<p>
The Rail simply uses a minibike fork with hydraulic shocks, obtained
when we ran the local gas-huffing motorbike gang out of town.  
</p>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=251 WIDTH=181 SRC="image/frail72.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Although it
is hard to see in this picture, the steer tube of this fork
is too long for the frame's head tube.  This is
remedied by sawing the required length off of a donor head tube,
sticking it on the host head tube, and attaching the top bearing races to
it.  We intend to braze it together some day.
</p>

<h2 align=center><a name="chopagatortech">Chopagator.</a></h2>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=182 WIDTH=254 SRC="image/fchop72.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Chopulator's forks are constructed along the lines of the BMX-Extendo
model, in that the straight tubes of a BMX fork are extended.  However,
the top fork is aligned vertically, not horizontally, and each of
the extended tubes ends in a curved fork, both of which grab the axle.
Beautiful.

<h2 align=center><a name="trifurcatortech">The Trifurcator.</a></h2>

<p align=center>
<IMG  HEIGHT=253 WIDTH=182 SRC="image/ftf72.jpg">
</p>

<p>
The Trifurcator is a simple model in which two whole forks are simply
welded together, much like a cross between the tops of Granddaddy and
the Orb.

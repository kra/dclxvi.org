<h1 align=center>Multi-Wheeled Vehicles.</h1>

<p>
Multi-track rides feel quite odd when one is accustomed to
a single-track
vehicle, and for this reason the intrepid builder is encouraged to
give them a try.
</p>

<p>
There are a few ways to go about making tricycles.  A
delta trike has two wheels in back, and a
tadpole trike has two in front.  They needn't be
symmetric; sidecar bikes have two inline wheels and an outrigger.
None of the wheels even need to be lined up frontwise or sidewise, so
the third wheel can be put anywhere between a delta or tadpole
placement.  A popular ladies' trike style in the first golden era was
to have one large driving wheel on one side, and two steering wheels
on the other side, one front and back.  One lever controlled both
steering wheels, which would twist in opposite directions.
</p>

<p>
The steering method is another difference to keep in mind, although
these variations aren't limited to multi-wheeled vehicles.
Direct steering is
like that on a normal bicycle - the handlebars are rigidly connected
to a single steer tube which the steering wheel or wheels rotates around.
There can be more than one wheel, such as on a Jakarta rickshaw, but
their position relative to each other around the headtube will be
fixed.  Think of the two nuts on a fork - the line between each of
them and the headtube axis never changes as it rotates.  With indirect steering, the
handlebars move a linkage which moves the wheels.  This is usually an
assembly of rods or cables which are connected by some
hinges with one degree of freedom.
When using indirect steering with multiple asymmetric steering wheels, be
prepared to know more than we do.
</p>

<p>
What every trike (and bike) does need is for all the wheels to be able
to turn at
separate rates.  Otherwise, one wheel will drag during turns.  If
there is more than one drive wheel, therefore, they will have to use
some kind of differential.
</p>

<p>
The greatest thrill from being on a trike comes from the
fact that it rides completely different from a bike.
On a bicycle, when a turn is executed, the bike starts to
move in a different direction, while inertia keeps the pilot moving
in a straight line.  If the bicycle does not pull the pilot
around the corner with it, the whole mess won't turn together.
Instead, the straight path of the pilot will pull the bike over
towards the outside of the
turn.  The bike doesn't provide any lateral support, so the only way to avoid
a crash after the bike has begun flopping towards the outside is to
yank the bike back under the pilot, and the only way to do this is to
reduce the turning radius.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this rarely happens, because every bicyclist has learned
that by leaning into turns,
the bike is kept under the combined vector of the forces of inertia
and gravity which is pushing the pilot, and successfully pulls
everything around the
turn.  Usually, the proper lean comes without thought, but if it
doesn't,
there are all sorts of fun things that can
happen.  If the bike is leaning too far inward, often because of a
skid, the pilot won't be supported and will fall
(&quot;lowside&quot;).
If the bike
suddenly isn't leaning far enough for the current turn radius, often
because a skidding wheel regains traction, the pilot will be
catapulted into the air when the bike acts like a polevaulter's pole
(the deadly &quot;highside&quot;).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, a trike isn't a single-track vehicle, and all the rules are
different.  The only thing keeping the trike under the pilot is a wide
wheelbase; if the vector of the force acting on the center of gravity
of everything involved points outside of
the wheels, the vehicle will start to flop to the outside of the
turn, as above, and the
inside wheel will leave the ground.  This is the opposite
of what one expects from a bicycle.  Trike tires
also get yanked to the side, and there is a lot of scrubbing.  Tilting
the machine is very stressful for the wheel that stays on the
ground, since it isn't 
made to deal with a sideways force.
</p>

<p>
An asymmetrical trike is a little weirder because
it will lean differently in different directions.
When it isn't kept stable by weight, it will have a great turn with
the outrigger on the outside, and a terrible turn with the outrigger in.

<h2 align=center><a name="deltatech">Delta and Outrigger Trikes.</a></h2>

<p>
With delta trikes, one has to figure out how to transmit power to a
driving wheel.  Sidecar hacks or other outrigger types are easy,
though - just mount a new coasting wheel onto the
frame.  The easiest way to make a sidecar is to use two frames that are
identical in geometry.  Keep the frames aligned horizontally and vertically when you attach them together, and you'll ensure that the coaster wheel is aligned with the driving wheel.  <em>Then</em> saw off what you don't want from the
outrigger frame.
<a href="../../meet/sensibletrike/index.html#hack">The Hack</a>
uses the bottom bracket, chainstays, and
downtube from a third frame in between the two, just to add more
support for the floor panels.  Put the sidecar on the curb side!  Not
only is this more polite to the passenger, but it makes riding much
easier, since the lean caused by a crowned road is supported by the
third wheel.

<h2 align=center><a name="directtadpoletech">Direct Steering Tadpole Trikes.</a></h2>

<p>
Tadpole trikes with direct steering can be made by affixing the front
wheels to a boxlike assembly which does all of the turning.  They
can be made without modifying anything behind
the head tube.  They make great cargo carriers, because
the two front wheels support the machine well during turns, rather
than tending to dive as a delta trike does.

		However, a tadpole trike with direct steering must have a
		perfectly vertical head
		tube.  Any angle will cause the frame to want to lean during
		turns, and an angle towards the rear will make it want to lean
		in the wrong
		direction.  The
		<a href="../../meet/sensibletrike/index.html#cargotrike">Cargo Trike</a>
		has a box with dropouts (just
		slots sawed into angle iron, actually) which is bolted to the
		fork 
		and handlebars, and the two parts were made in separate
		locations.  One front wheel was put on the fork, and the frame
		was ridden to where the box was waiting for assembly.  The
		fork and wheels
		bolt onto identical lengths of angle iron which are welded to
		the same plane of the box, so the headtube angle should have
		been been easy to figure out - just set the
		headtube with one wheel in the fork - but the angle is off by
		a about a
		degree.  A better way might be to assemble the fork in the
		headtube, bolt everything to the box, and then weld the
		headtube to the frame.

<p>
The cargo trike frame is attached to the fork by an axle which is
slid through a pair of holes in two pieces of angle iron and bolted
down.  The space between the angle iron is filled with washers.  The
handlebar fittings come from a Wald basket, and tended to work loose
until some threadlocking compound was used.

		Indirect steering isn't a big deal.  Just make sure that all of your
		steering angles and arms are the same, or at least close.  Indirect
		steering with two steering wheels is a slightly bigger deal.  Each
		steering wheel needs to move exactly the same, which means that the
		wheels, tires, forks, and headtube angles must be identical.  Well,
		maybe if you're making a high-performance trike, but in reality, just
		pick two wheels and tires of the same size, and try for closeness with
		the forks.

		The steering linkage for the

		uses bearings connected by threaded steel rods.
		There are many other steering mechanisms out there, however,
		as well as cheaper ways to use pushrods.  A bolt with a space
		created by locknuts which passes through a hole in a connector
		made of bar stock would work, but get the
		measurement right the first time!

		The bearings
		are bolted to arms made out of steel plates, two brazed to
		each fork, pointing straight forward and back.  There are a few
		ideas about how to angle the arms on a steering linkage.  Cars
		use Ackermann steering, in which lines extending the arms
		intersect on the back axle.  We didn't know about that, but
		this trike only noticeably scrubs the wheels during the
		tightest possible turns, which aren't performed at speed,
		anyway.  Two rods connect the wheels because a single rod
		tends to flex and cause the farther wheel to shimmy.  That's
		also the reason behind the wooden dowels which are ziptied to
		the rods.  If you look closely at the headtube, you can see a
		sawed off
		centerpull brake cable anchor with a hole in it, which is
		where the bearings were originally anchored.  This hole
		eventually became ovalized, leading to more slop.

<p>
Aligning everything together during construction wasn't as much of a
hassle as it was for the Cargo Trike, because angles with respect to
the ground weren't important, only angles relative to each other.
Also, unlike the Cargo Trike, the trail can be adjusted by changing
the relative sizes of the front and rear wheels.
The
first members were the two outermost frames.  Only the headtubes
needed to be well aligned.  The frames were clamped into a bike stand
and a vise, respectively, with each head tube perfectly vertical as
measured repeatedly with a level.  The frames were then connected with
the frontmost tubes.  The rest of the center portion had to be
perpendicular with the line between these headtubes, but it could be
tackled piece by piece.  The front bottom bracket was first of these.
The
existing structure was placed so that the headtubes rested on a level
surface, ensuring that a level bottom bracket would be aligned with
them.  The  chainstays and seattube of the BB's frame were kept as
structural members,
and grinding the end of each chainstay bit by bit was an excellent way
to make sure that it was aligned in the absence of a proper jig.  The
BB, by the way, is both reversed and upside down, so that it's facing
the same way as it was in its earlier life.  That way, the pedaling
action doesn't tend to loosen any threads.  This might not be strictly
necessary, but it's nice.
</p>

<p>
The two remaining parts of the center line of the frame were then
assembled, and
welded to themselves and the rest of the frame all at once.  Things were
kept aligned here by tightly clamping a pair of two by fours to the
structure with C-clamps and lots of zipties.  Since each piece has a
complete frame triangle in it, at two tubes of which were between the
planks, this kept everything straight.  The various supports
were added as the need arose.

<h2 align=center>The Whys and Wherefores.</h2>

<p>
Once one has hacked one's chopper, one will be pleased to
acquire the proper gear.  Gear makes one stronger, more powerful,
better protected, faster, slower, drunker.  Gear may be
scoffed at, but the simple truth is that gear is a useful tool for
domination.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Experiment:</strong> the subject joined a touch football game in
which the subject wore a bicycle helmet (and no other gear other than
the standard shoes, clothes, and bellyfull of beer),
while the head of every other
player was bare.  Results: the subject
dominated so very well that the other players would not let him play
unless the helmet was removed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Observation:</strong> a pair of roller-blading
tykes jumping off of a set of stairs, wearing helmets, elbow and knee
pads, and those nifty wrist braces.  Upon the frequent act of wiping
out, they laughed, got up again, and proceeded anew.  Note how the act
of crashing becomes enjoyable with the proper gear!

<h2 align=center>The Social Aspects.</h2>

<p>
The corporate slimelordz of America have fixated upon gear as
an easy method of sponging money from yuppies and yuppy wannabes.
"Mountain" bikers and rollerbladers are the key dupes of this
movement.  They purchase gear because they like to purchase
things.  They can be identified by their use of "high performance"
gear, flashy gear where a high priority is placed on looks, and gear
upon which is emblazoned an advertisement for a company (thus
announcing the amount of money wasted in its purchase).  Such dupes also
enjoy scoffing at those without the same gear as they.
</p>

<p>
These people
have, of course, missed the point.  They perform the act to don the
gear, rather than donning the gear to perform the act.  They feel that
gear bestows prowess, when in truth it merely allows prowess to be
better expressed.
</p>

	At the other end of the spectrum are the no-gear fanatics.  They sneer
	at any kind of gear, claiming that it reveals a certain wimpiness in
	those who wear it.  These people do not realize that gear allows one
	to fuck shit up, and in turn get one's shit fucked up, with impunity.
	Neither do they see that gear does not imply a fear of wiping, but
	rather an
	embracing of the act, a willingness to meet the event and, most
	importantly, to continue afterwards.
	</p>
	<p>
	The foolishness of the no-gear
	position is made clear when one examines the greatest, most prominent
	article of natural gear bestowed by the Creator upon each member of
	the human race: the padded ass.  Not once
	has a gear-sneerer used liposuction to effect the denial of this
	fundamental gear item.

<h2 align=center>The Choice of Gear.</h2>

<p>
The best gear, is, of course, that gear which one feels comfortable
thrashing in.  While fake-thrashing one's gear beforehand is the act
of the poseur, gear that has been thrashed and is still sturdy is gear that
can thrash again.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, gear should be as strong and
as cheap as possible.  The cheapest gear is gear that is
scrounged or jerry-rigged for the purpose at hand.  In fact, there is
no real reason to go gearless, as many
elements of the gear ensemble can be constructed with the ubiquitous
duct tape and baling wire.  An ordinary shirt and pair of trousers of
which the joints have been carefully padded with generous layers of
duct-tape will allow one to embrace the pavement at high speeds.  That
worn-out old pair of shoes, when combined with an integrated brace of
blown tire and inner tube shinguards, becomes a mighty pair of
shitkickers.
</p>

<p>
Rising from the homebrew gear kit, we have the refunctionalized gear,
gear which has either been adapted to its purpose or which would
normally be retired.  The majority of headwear fits this category.
Garage-sale bicycle and motorcycle helmets, football, army, and construction
helmets, and even Viking helmets with added straps have served to
encourage
dwindling collections of brain cells to retain their coherent mass.  Ski or
aviator gogs with a handkerchief taped to the bottom protect the
sensitive face when diving (or being thrown) through plate glass
windows.  Boxing gloves, however, are discouraged for activities which 
require
the use of fingers.
</p>

<p>
Finally, let us not forget that gear which is meant to be used after
the act which it is made for, as opposed to during.  A bottle of
whiskey and a needle and thread make a swell first-aid kit - and
remember, superglue was invented during the Vietnam war to suture
wounds.  A pump
and a patch kit, as well as assorted parts, helps ensure that one will not
be walking home.  A wrench will tighten bolts that have worked loose,
as well as drive off bands of mutants.

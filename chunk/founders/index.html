<p>
In 1893, two intrepid young American gentlemen, Dr. Burnout and Wilhelm
"Papa" Wheelie, were exploring the deserts of Asia when they discovered an
amazing mystery cult deep in the heart of Mongolia.  The high priests
of this cult possessed objects of a technology centuries more advanced
than anything known to western civilization.
</p>

<p>
Wheelie and Burnout were unable to comprehend at that time that these
objects were the detrius of an ancient alien spacecraft that had
crash-landed in the area millennia ago.  As the eerie radiations
emitted by these implements produced a disoriented state in the
explorers, they theorized that the devices had been
constructed by the locals according to the instructions of highly
self-actualized citizens of the future, who used the spirits of the
dead to relay their messages into the past.  Their journals tell of a
midnight visitation by one such citizen known as "Chunkulus Prime",
who urged them to "bring my teachings to your home and preach them to
the world" so that "the planet may achieve Level Three".

<p>
The two gentlemen brought back schematics of some of these artifacts
back to America, and founded the
<em>The Brotherhood of the Eternally Rotating Wheel</em>.
This was a somewhat whacked spiritualist organization and temperance league
which sought enlightenment 
through the stimulation delivered by devices constructed by Burnout
and Wheelie based on what they had seen in Asia.  Unfortunately,
errors in their notes caused these devices to produce the opposite
effect than that intended by the explorers; rather than becoming
enlightened, cultured beings, the brothers of the Brotherhood found
themselves growing crude and unmannerly.

<p>
It was at this point that Roy D. joined the Brotherhood.
At first, he just wanted to ride the bikes, which only the Brethren
were allowed to access.  Soon, however, he found that the wide-band
chunkulation
field caused him to become strong, aggressive, and ambitious.  He
quickly dominated the organization.  Sweeping changes were
instituted.  The punch was spiked.  Rather than riding in placid
circles in their "Rink of the Meditations", the Brethren took to the
streets.  With D. goading them into a frenzy, they found themselves
booted out of town, and took to wandering the countryside, always just
one step ahead of the law.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, traditional bicycle technology continued to progress.  With
the invention of the
the "safety bicycle", bicycling became an important factor in womens'
liberation, rather than a sport for gentlemen alone.
These advances came far too slowly for two uppity young women,
known today only as "Chunk Lady" and "Trike Lady".  They felt nothing
but content for the "bloomer-wearing wimps and their silly hats" who
filled the streets of the day.  Constructing their own choppers, they
tracked down the wandering Brotherhood and announced their intention
to join.  The Brethren resisted - they didn't want to lose the
cigar-chomping "old boy" feel of the gang - but the ladies were more
powerful.  After they demonstrated their skills by riding the
Brethren into the ground and cracking a few skulls, they were welcomed
into the flock.  Tired of their wanderings, they established the
Secret Hideout, and began raiding the countryside for supplies and
recruits.
C.H.U.N.K. 666 as we know it today was formed.
</p>

<p>
The machines of Wheelie and Burnout had strange life-extending effects
on Chunk Lady and Trike Lady.  Despite several spectacular crashes
that often severed limbs and even heads from their bodies, they have
outlasted the
usual short lifespan of the Chunker many times over, and survive to
this day.

<p>
Chunk Lady is extremely reclusive, and only leaves her fortress to get
supplies under the cover of heavy rain or snow.  She is both wily and
quick, and we have been unable to approach her closely.

<p>
Trike Lady is more sociable, taking leisurely rides throughout the
neighborhood.  She will sometimes allow a lone Chunker to coast alongside
her for a few blocks and receive valuable advice.  We've asked her to
come on rides with us, but she refuses each time, grumbling about how
kids these days are "wimps" and reminding us about the time that she
hauled five refreshment modules up the hill and drank three of them on
the way.

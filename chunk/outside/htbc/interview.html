    Yeah, we have 13 Commandments.  Normally I would have
it written on the inside of my jacket, but
the Hells Angels took my colors from me in another town.  The first
Commandment is <strong> destroy all cars</strong>.  The second is <strong> drink
beer</strong>.  The third is <strong> drink beer</strong>.  The fourth Commandment, is,
um...  <strong>  drrrinnnk beeeer</strong>, um, no, that was the Second Commandment.

    Oh yeah!  <strong> Fight, bleed, help people in need, die</strong>.  Every
single one of those commandments has been done.  Death, fuckin' blood,
fuckin' drinking a lot, get hopped up on reefer...   I'll wait until
Jacob gets here, he carries the Commandments on his jacket.  He's the
Commandment Bearer, if anyone tries to take him down, we gotta kill
him first, it's kind of cool.  We haven't had to do that yet, because
nobody cares, and I'm glad nobody cares, because I don't <em> want</em> anybody
to care.  The worst thing that we ever had happen to us was when the
fucking Hells Angels tried to...  I was in this bar called Whiskey
Junction one night, and this guy came up to us, he's one of those guys
who hangs out with biker gangs and really wants to get, you know, he
sucks everyone dick or something like that.  I don't know his name, I
wish I did, because if you're going to write this in a major paper I'd
like to tell him a little message.  Which I'll tell him another day,
anyway.  But anyway, so, he says, ``Man, you can't wear those fuckin'
colors'', and I'm like, ``what are you talking about?''  He's like,
``Those are Hell's Angel's colors.''  And I was like, ``Okay, well
I'll talk to the President of the Hells Angels some other day.  He's
like, ``Well, he's sitting right over there!''  So I'm like, okay, I
guess I have to go talk to him <strong> now</strong>, because if I don't, this
guy's gonna go over there and start a bunch of shit, and we're gonna
get our kneecaps broken, and tire tracks on our fucking heads.  Wide
tire tracks.  I fuckin' <strong> hate</strong> wide tire tracks.  Anyway, so I
walk over to him, and say, ``I hear there was some controversy.''  I
was really courteous about it and everything.  I said, ``I heard there
was some controversy, I heard that there's a conflict between the
colors that I wear and the colors that you wear.''  He said, ``Where
are they?  Let me see them.''  I say, ``They're in my van right now.''
So I take him out to my van, which is this huge black van, it's real
cheesy, it looks like a gangster van, it's got no windows and shit.
It's like the A-team's.  I bring him up there, and he's fixing his
pistol and putting on his lead-plated glove and shit.  I turn around
and I'm like, ``Dude, I'm not fucking with you.  You could destroy me
about that quick, no matter what.''  He's got his bodyguard with him,
who would bump that ledge up there.  Anyway, so, he looks at
them and says, ``I have to bring these to the clubhouse and talk to
the rest of the boys.''  So I'm like, What-ever, man, you're a
fucking bore.  If I was doing this during `toys for tots', you'd be
too busy to fucking care, cause you'd be running drugs in teddy bears
and shit like that.  Anyway, we go back into the club, and they're all
laughing at us, and shit, they're like, ``Oh, you're a <strong> bicycle</strong>
club!'', and I'm like, ``Yeah, didn't you notice the weird
bicycles out here and shit?''  They were laughing.  Finally, we went
to the clubhouse the next day, and they were like, ``We're gonna have
to ceremoniously burn these jackets.''  I'm like, ``Okay, whatever.
That's cool, have fun.  I hope you have a raving good time.''  What
the fuck, you know?  So, I don't know why I started talking about
this.  That was like, we were on the topic of the stupidest thing that
ever happened?

    I can't believe that we threatened a group of people who were
the first biker gang in practically the fuckin' world almost, except
for old ones like the Wild Angels, little ones, the Devil's
Prophets.  Like the Hell's Angels, they're the major largest biker
club in the world.  The guys in Russia, the Hell's Angels, the main
chapter in Russia, in the Soviet Union, they have one clubhouse,
the size of this fucking room that we're in, and they have a Harley
Davidson that is not even working.  I saw a picture of them in,
what's that biker magazine, they were like, ``Our motorcycle is not
working yet.  But soon we shall receive the parts, as soon as our
country is free.''  It's these 50 guys, and they take turns
sitting on the motorcycle, like they're riding it, and get pictures
taken with these big Helga women sitting on the back.  Really
super-funny.  It's like, god, man, I'm just doing it for fun.

that we

Chester around the buildings, he's passed out, very slow pulse, he's
just laying there practically dead, and I've had to carry him out to

beard, and talks a bunch of shit that makes absolutely no sense

it into our friend Per's shop, and that was the beginning.  That was
about four and a half years ago.  We just started pumping them out and
everyone started riding them for the fun of it, and we made these
patches, and we were having fun, and we were going to the motorcycle
rallies, and showing them that there's more than just motorcycles and

    Yeah.  I've tried to follow him, and he turned around and
pointed at me, and I was so embarrassed that I was following him
that I turned away and I turned back, and he's gone.  I'm serious.
It's happened to several people.  I've been following him, right, and
he turns around, right before he's about to duck into this portal
somewhere, and looks at me, and says,
``What's happening?  What's shakin'?''  I turn away
like I'm not really me, I'm like ``oh, la la lalala,'', and I look
back, and he's gone.  And then I'll go down to the West Bank, I'm
driving on the fucking freeway, and he beats me.  Walking.  He doesn't
have a car, the guy doesn't own anything.  He doesn't have a pot to
piss in.  He owns a fucking pair of pants that he pisses in, you know?
That's one of the phenomenas of traveling.  That's what I'm
into.  I want him to give me some clues before he, you know, so I can
pass them on.

    It was just a funky idea that came out of boredom, really.  The
winters are really long.  And of course you wanna play with tools.
And the idea of a tall bike came out.  And it evolved from there.  You
know, every artist says, ``oh, this will be the <strong> fucking thing</strong>
that no-one else has ever thought of'', which is of course bullshit.
We made these tall bikes, and we didn't find out until last month that
they were made in 1946, whatever, the 1920s.

    Like we were talking about the Hell's Angels, like we were wearing
colors, and they decided that some punks wearing similar colors to
what they fucking run, it's like some fucking threat.  And they chose
to take the fucking course to decide that we weren't allowed to wear
anything similar to what they may have pertained of thoughts before.
And that's silly because as you have already experienced here -
we made these bikes, and then out of nowhere, you already made your
machine without ever knowing who we were.  And the colors we wear
just became some inspiration, we decided that it was deeming to fit
our expression.    The whole point is that these biker clubs, these
people, it's not ``these people'', I don't want to give any
individual, any group, orientation, but they've decided that we
weren't even fitting, and it's like, shit, other people are creating
these ideas, just as if, we won't find any conflict with you, or your
group.

    There is no conflict.  There should be none.  Created out of

other people are willing to really think.  We don't wanna be like most
people who decided that because we're not cool like them or we're not
in the drug scene, or we don't sell shit, we don't work their way, to
bow down to their thing.  Of course there's going to be conflict, with
that thing, because we decide to resist what they say is wrong, and
they are much stronger than us, in people, you know, and whatever.  Fuck
them!  We're going to do what we wanna do.  And they can fuckin' come
and get us.  Fuck them!  They can ride their fucking machines all they
want.  Anyone can ride a machine, anyone can make a tall bike.  It
doesn't take a genius.  There's a lot of welders out there, a lot of
people with fucking different ideas.  So as it stands, I would say
that it's really what they're doing.  They only strengthen their
position, that they're sheep.

    Well, basically, if you were to steal a bike, it would be an
expensive bike.  We cannot weld expensive bikes, we have so much stuff
donated to us we have to literally give away half the shit that we
make.  Our welding equipment isn't designed to weld on chro-moly or
alloys of any kind.  Just old steel junk bikes.  What we do is go
around to bars, show our bikes off a little, people come up to us and
say ``I've got a garage full of bikes I've got to get rid of.  You got
a truck?  Okay, come pick them up'', they
give me their phone number.  It works out really well, people are

    Yeah, actually, I went garage saleing last summer, and a lady was
selling a bunch of bikes for $5 a pop, and they were whole bikes.  So
I said, ``well, you got any junk parts lying around?'' and she had a
whole garage full of it, she gave me all these parts for $5.
We really have to remain legal.  We can't afford to screw up
cause we're a club, we're in the public eye, there's been a bunch of
articles about us, TV shows are in the wings, you know?  It's true,
though, I show people, you know, if they seem interested, I'll show
them how to gink stuff if they want.  I don't recommend it, I believe
when the Chunk guys came to visit me, it was right after I had all but
three or four of my tools stolen, so I was pretty hyped to still have
those.  Some of those tools can be used to break U-locks, so, I
bragged about it a little...   There actually isn't that much bike
theft in Minnesota because it's so cold, there aren't a whole lot of
bike riders, you know.

    She accepts that.  As much.  Not more.  No. Nonononono.  I said
that straight up.  Don't ever ask me to quit drinking and don't ever
tell me to get a car if I don't want to.  I'll buy <em> you</em> a car,
fine.  Drive, smog the fuckin air up, but I'm riding my bike.  I'll
meet you there, and I'll bet you I'll beat you.  I've made bets with
people like that, and I've won money.

    ``I'll bet you I'll beat you home on my bicycle.''  They're like,
``No way, man.''  I got chased two nights ago by a bunch of
gangsters in San Francisco.  I was up on a hill on Haight, and they
were like, ``Yomuthafucka, yo honkey, what happens when you fall off
that bike?'' and they all whipped 40-ounce bottles at me.  Boom boom
boom boom!  I was like shit, man, I'm in Beirut, and I started
pedaling my narrow white ass out.  I said, ``I'll jump off this
motherfucker, land on my feet, and <em> kill you</em>!  And they like got
in their car and went [screeching tire noise] and chased me down the hill.
I got up on the sidewalk, was ducking trees and signs, it was really
fun, actually, once I got out of it.  I was scared as hell.  I'd get
to the margin of the sidewalk, right where the street starts, and the
light, boom!  fucking
turns red.  And I just - whoosh!  Cars were honking.  But I made it.
I did.  I made a breach of traffic where they couldn't pass.  Then I
get down to Market and my handlebars came off.  I was like, oh shit!
I was reaching out, I still have the brakes, and I have the
handlebars in my hand, so I'm like hitting the brakes and bouncing at
the same time.  All these people were like, ``What's up, mothafucker,
stupid honkey boy.''  I'm just like, ``whoawhoawhoa, it's just a
trick, don't worry, man, just a trick.''  I grab on to the sign pole
to slow myself down, wiped out, but landed fine, about half a block
from where I'm staying, so I lucked out on that ticket.
